            <h2 id="what-is-monkey-patching%3F">What is monkey patching?</h2>

<p>I first learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a> via the Ruby community. Due to how
the language worked, Rubyists tended to override dependencies in their
tests at run-time, rather than using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double">test doubles</a>.
Personally I find the ability to redefine <em>any</em> part of the language to be interesting. It 
certainly does make testing easier.</p>

<p>Now, PHP doesn't support the sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> that lends
itself to making monkey patching easy. Sure, you used to be able to use the Runkit extension but
these days, it's not being maintained. So, when we run into a situation where you need to redefine
some functionality at run time, your options are limited.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-it%3F">When to use it?</h2>

<p>Like I said before, it can be an alternative to using test doubles. But there are also some
interesting scenarios where, due to both PHP's behaviour and the architecture of an application,
we can make a change at run time.</p>

<p>At my <a href="https://smartours.com">current gig</a> I was adding some functionality
to verify some objects representing the prices of objects are configured
correctly. One of my tests was to ensure that a specific exception was
being triggered, and that meant creating a new exception object that
extended a "loggable" one.</p>

<p>This is code that is being implemented as a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin</a>
for WordPress and the logging object I needed to use had some very
WordPress-specific functionality in it. But I didn't want to have to use all
the WordPress-specific stack just for this test. On top of this, the logging
object wasn't in a namespace that my <a href="https://phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a> tests could
even see.</p>

<p>So what were my options? My first was to modify the <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>
autoloading configuration and add the namespace to it. I then had a way to
"force" logging into "test mode" but I wasn't entirely happy with it. The
tests passed, the exception was being triggered, but I had worries in the back
of my mind about whether or not we'd have to do something to the WordPress
side of the application in order to support this.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://phpc.social/@omerida">co-worker</a> showed me how they were already overriding some things at run-time,
so it was better to go with what was already working. Introducing uncertainty
into our application was not the end goal. Here was their solution:</p>

<p>There was an existing <code>test/bootstrap.php</code> file so it was suggested to add a run-time
check to see if the application was attempting to instantiate our logging
object via an autoloader and then instead tell it to use a different one.</p>

<p>First, a replacement logger was created...</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace Smartours\Log;

use Monolog\Handler\NullHandler;
use Monolog\Logger;

class Log
{
    public static function logger(): Logger
    {
        $logger = new Logger('generic');
        $logger-&gt;pushHandler(new NullHandler());

        return $logger;
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>...and then we just included it in our bootstrap file.</p>

<pre><code>require __DIR__ . '/bootstrap/SmartoursLog.php';
</code></pre>

<p>Now, my code that is calling an exception...that needs that
base <code>Log</code> object...will use my <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">fake</a>
instead.</p>

<p>The test passes and all is in order again.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-alternatives%3F">What are some alternatives?</h2>

<p>In a more testable world, what logging object the code is
expecting to use could be done via a configuration file. We'd
still be creating a fake logger, but the mechanism to load it
would be different. Most "modern" PHP web application frameworks
support the use of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern">service locaters</a>
and they can be leveraged to make sure your tests have access
to the dependencies they need.</p>

<p>In the future, if we ever needed to add tests for things like making
sure the message the exception we throw shows up in the correct log
file, this solution will have to adapt to those needs.</p>

<p>As always, everyone's testing situation is different and finding
one that fits your need is more important than being perfect..</p>
