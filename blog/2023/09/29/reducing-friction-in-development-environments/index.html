            <h1 id="reducing-friction-in-development-environments">Reducing Friction in Development Environments</h1>

<p>As my 27th year of getting paid to create web applications
starts to wind down, I reflect on how hard I work to try
and create a development environment experience (heh, that
sounds so pretentious when spoken out loud!) that has as
little friction as possible.</p>

<p>Late in 2023, what does that look like for me?</p>

<h2 id="learn-your-editor">Learn your editor</h2>

<p>I have lost count of the number of editors I have used over
the years. Some I would never touch again. Some I felt changed
how people built all future editors. If it was available for
my Mac, I was at least trying it out.</p>

<p>One thing that did eventually change was that I
settled on one editor (well, sort-of) and dedicated time
to exploring it's other features beyond just editing text.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I really don't care what editor you use.
I just think you should pick one and learn it really well.</p>

<p>I do flip back and forth between <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>
and <a href="https://neovim.io">NeoVim</a>, depending on the task.
Years of using Vim and NeoVim has imprinted both modal
editing and Vim keybindings into my muscle memory, so
I have Vim bindings installed for PhpStorm.</p>

<p>If your editor has an extensive list of keyboard shortcuts,
take the time to learn all the common ones. While I'm
not some kind of productivity grifter, I do feel like reducing
the number of times your hands leave your keyboard can
only be a good thing.</p>

<p>I should probably stop grabbing my phone so much too.</p>

<p>Learning how to use your editor and how easily it can integrate
with other tools is, for me, the first step towards reducing
friction.</p>

<h2 id="repeatability">Repeatability</h2>

<p>"Works on my machine" is both a joke and a reality when you do
development work. Here are some solutions I recommend:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> to create containers that duplicate production</li>
<li><a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix and NixOS</a> to make reproducible systems</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is that you can reduce friction by adopting
tools that allow other people to use the same dependencies
that you are using. Yes, it can be annoying and frustrating
to get thing "just right", along with duplicating a production
environments that relies on a ton of services. But once you
have it as close to production as possible, the time to get
code out of your development environment and into production
is greatly reduced.</p>

<h2 id="standards">Standards</h2>

<p>Coding standards make sure your code all looks the same. I should
not be able to figure out who wrote some code by looking at it.
Static code analysis applies standards in terms of how the code
you wrote should be used by others. Testing standards ensure
that you have confidence that the code you wrote will continue
to behave in the way you expect it to.</p>

<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>

<p>For me, this is the one that I think a lot of developers need
to embrace more. Write small shell scripts to execute multiple
commands that you type into your CLI. Use Makefiles. Add things
to your <code>composer.json</code> file so you can type <code>composer test</code>
and have the tests run.</p>

<p>Everything you can do to automate repetitive tasks is one less
thing you have to remember. I'd rather be working on solving
a business-related problem than remembering what order I need
to run these 10 commands to get my code from my laptop and into
production.</p>

<h2 id="willingness-to-learn">Willingness to Learn</h2>

<p>I don't know how typical I am in terms of evaluating my tools
and techniques on a regular basis, but I feel like my willingness
to learn new things and try out new tools that solve old problems
has really helped me reduce friction.</p>

<p>Except for rebasing things in Git. That still gives me so many
problems and I will go to my post-programming life insisting
that version control systems do not need to be so complicated.</p>

<h2 id="too-much-friction-causes-fires">Too Much Friction Causes Fires</h2>

<p>I think my over-arching point is that the tools you use to
write code every day should not cause you problems. It's entirely
possible I have learned to ignore the rough edges my tools
present (Vim certainly has a steep learning curve) but I truly
work on making sure a computer does repetitive actions for me
as much as possible. It's not going to complain about it to me.</p>

<p>I hope I've gotten you to start evaluating or re-evaluating your
chosen tools and find some new-or-different ways to reduce
any friction you are finding in your development environments
and processes.</p>
