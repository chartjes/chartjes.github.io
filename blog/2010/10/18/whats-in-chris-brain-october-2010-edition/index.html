            <p>I haven't done one of these for a while, so I thought I'd share some stuff I've been looking at lately.  Also, I'm not doing anything earth-shattering that needs a blog post. ;)</p>

<h3>Stange Loop Conference</h3>

<p>
I found out about this <a href="http://strangeloop2010.com/">conference</a> via Twitter.  I enjoyed St. Louis immensely when the family drove 17 hours to visit my wife's brother and his wife 3 years ago.  The zoo there is awesome and free!  Anyway, there were a lot of interesting talks given using a wide variety of languages and tools.  Nice to see a conference that was focused on what I call the "future shock" technologies:   ones that use paradigms that are very different from the mainstream and trying to show you practical uses for them.  One that stood out was Kyle Simpson's <a href="http://strangeloop2010.com/talks/14469">"Dude, That's some Strange UI Architecture"</a>.  He did a brief demo of a Javascript-powered framework that used what he called Client-View-Controller, where EVERYTHING is Javascript except the black box that is your data source.  The tl;dr version?  Javascript on the client and the server, use <a href="http://github.com/leeoniya/handlebar.js"> for templating, and make sure your data source can accept and return JSON.  Very interesting, and worth checking out.

<h3>Sharding and NoSQL - Be careful!</h3>

<p>
Great blog post on one of my favourite reads, the High Scalability blog, about the problems Foursquare experienced with MongoDB and <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2010/10/15/troubles-with-sharding-what-can-we-learn-from-the-foursquare.html">what can be learned from it.</a>  Lesson #1 of superhyped technologies:  make sure the damn thing works for what YOU need it to do.  MySQL and Postgres are also great key-value stores.  It's all about understanding your data, not ditching JOINS because someone else told you to.

<h3>Make an Infoproduct</h3>

<p>
My internet-famous sort-of-friend (meaning we've known each other for a while via the internet and have actually met in person, once, in Toronto) <a href="http://twitter.com/amyhoy">Amy Hoy</a> is hustling her way to piles of cash by sharing the skills she's developed along the way.  Go and read her awesome post on <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2010/make-an-infoproduct/">making digital goods that you can sell.</a>.  Amy catches a lot of flack for her willingness to express her desire to make MONEY from her SKILLS.  Having already done this once myself, to middling success (my <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/book">CakePHP book</a> has done better than I thought it would, but probably not as good as it really could've) I can tell you that Amy knows what she is talking about.  Don't listen to the haters, go and make something you can charge money for!.
