            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m not a New Year’s resolution type but here are some suggestions for my fellow devs of things I believe can lead to better outcomes:</p>

<p>Learn your IDE/editor better: I spent a lot of 2021 refining my <a href="https://neovim.org">Vim</a> setup and I plan on adding increased use of <a href="https://vimwiki.github.io/">VimWiki</a> for making notes and linking things together.</p>

<p>If your dynamic language of choice supports types, start using them and <a href="https://psalm.dev">static</a> <a href="https://phpstan.org">analysis</a> tools. It leads to much clearer intent and can catch problems at the edges.</p>

<p>Focus on automation. Stop doing things manually the computer can do for you. Take the time to semi-automate manual processes first. It frees your brain up to solve different problems.</p>

<p>Make continuous learning a foundation of everything you do. Even after 23 years of getting paid to program, I learn new things almost every day.</p>

<p>Remember that what people call “luck” is often you having the skills to take advantage of an opportunity.</p>
