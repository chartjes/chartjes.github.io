            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I write this blog post, Twitter is convulsing as it's new
owner Elon Musk is trying to treat a huge cruise ship like
it's a jetski. Having cut a ton of staff and literally workshopping
ideas in public, it's not going well.</p>

<p>I have ignored blogging and some other interactions as Twitter made
it so easy to share those little thoughts and I also became reliant
on a curated feed to find stuff I was interested in. Along the way
I ran into the idea of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>.</p>

<p>I have made a non-trivial amount of money off selling my <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/chartjes">books</a>
and have dabbled in paid courses and workshops. So it made a lot of
sense to me to check out this <a href="https://indiewebify.me">guide to joining the IndieWeb</a>
and learn about <a href="https://microformats.org">microformats</a>, <a href="http://webmention.org/">Webmentions</a>
and start really leaning into POSSEing (Publish on my Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere)
my stuff.</p>

<p>This is the first blog post that (if I have set up things correctly at my end) that
will be syndicated out to other platforms.</p>
