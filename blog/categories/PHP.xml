            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-is-monkey-patching%3F">What is monkey patching?</h2>

<p>I first learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a> via the Ruby community. Due to how
the language worked, Rubyists tended to override dependencies in their
tests at run-time, rather than using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double">test doubles</a>.
Personally I find the ability to redefine <em>any</em> part of the language to be interesting. It 
certainly does make testing easier.</p>

<p>Now, PHP doesn't support the sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> that lends
itself to making monkey patching easy. Sure, you used to be able to use the Runkit extension but
these days, it's not being maintained. So, when we run into a situation where you need to redefine
some functionality at run time, your options are limited.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-it%3F">When to use it?</h2>

<p>Like I said before, it can be an alternative to using test doubles. But there are also some
interesting scenarios where, due to both PHP's behaviour and the architecture of an application,
we can make a change at run time.</p>

<p>At my <a href="https://smartours.com">current gig</a> I was adding some functionality
to verify some objects representing the prices of objects are configured
correctly. One of my tests was to ensure that a specific exception was
being triggered, and that meant creating a new exception object that
extended a "loggable" one.</p>

<p>This is code that is being implemented as a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin</a>
for WordPress and the logging object I needed to use had some very
WordPress-specific functionality in it. But I didn't want to have to use all
the WordPress-specific stack just for this test. On top of this, the logging
object wasn't in a namespace that my <a href="https://phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a> tests could
even see.</p>

<p>So what were my options? My first was to modify the <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>
autoloading configuration and add the namespace to it. I then had a way to
"force" logging into "test mode" but I wasn't entirely happy with it. The
tests passed, the exception was being triggered, but I had worries in the back
of my mind about whether or not we'd have to do something to the WordPress
side of the application in order to support this.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://phpc.social/@omerida">co-worker</a> showed me how they were already overriding some things at run-time,
so it was better to go with what was already working. Introducing uncertainty
into our application was not the end goal. Here was their solution:</p>

<p>There was an existing <code>test/bootstrap.php</code> file so it was suggested to add a run-time
check to see if the application was attempting to instantiate our logging
object via an autoloader and then instead tell it to use a different one.</p>

<p>First, a replacement logger was created...</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace Smartours\Log;

use Monolog\Handler\NullHandler;
use Monolog\Logger;

class Log
{
    public static function logger(): Logger
    {
        $logger = new Logger('generic');
        $logger-&gt;pushHandler(new NullHandler());

        return $logger;
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>...and then we just included it in our bootstrap file.</p>

<pre><code>require __DIR__ . '/bootstrap/SmartoursLog.php';
</code></pre>

<p>Now, my code that is calling an exception...that needs that
base <code>Log</code> object...will use my <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">fake</a>
instead.</p>

<p>The test passes and all is in order again.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-alternatives%3F">What are some alternatives?</h2>

<p>In a more testable world, what logging object the code is
expecting to use could be done via a configuration file. We'd
still be creating a fake logger, but the mechanism to load it
would be different. Most "modern" PHP web application frameworks
support the use of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern">service locaters</a>
and they can be leveraged to make sure your tests have access
to the dependencies they need.</p>

<p>In the future, if we ever needed to add tests for things like making
sure the message the exception we throw shows up in the correct log
file, this solution will have to adapt to those needs.</p>

<p>As always, everyone's testing situation is different and finding
one that fits your need is more important than being perfect..</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the reasons many experienced developers encourage the concept of
"decoupling your code" is so that it makes testing your code straightforward.
I wanted to share an example of how I went about writing some tests for
some code that I had refactored from being a tangled spaghetti-like mess.</p>

<p>Here is the code I am looking at, written targeting PHP 8.1.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Webreg\Query;

use Slim\Psr7\Response;
use Slim\Psr7\Request;
use Twig\Environment;
use Webreg\Repository\GameRepository;
use Webreg\ViewModel\Rotations;

final class RotationManagementQuery
{
    public function __construct(
        private Environment $twig,
        private GameRepository $gameRepository,
        private Rotations $rotations
    ) {}

    public function __invoke(Request $request): Response
    {
        $params = $request-&gt;getQueryParams();
        $maxWeek = $this-&gt;gameRepository-&gt;getMaxWeek();
        $week = (isset($params['week'])) ? (int) $params['week'] : $maxWeek;
        $rotations = $this-&gt;rotations-&gt;getAllByWeek($week);
        $response = new Response(200, null);
        $response-&gt;getBody()-&gt;write($this-&gt;twig-&gt;render('rotations/management.twig', [
            'current_week' =&gt; $week,
            'rotations' =&gt; $rotations,
        ]));

        return $response;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am using <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">Command Query Responsibility Segregation</a> in
this application's architecture, and this bit of code is a Query that will
retrieve a collection of pitchers who will be starting for baseball
teams in my simulation baseball league for a particular week.</p>

<p>In following some rules for decoupling, you can see some of the
following decisions had been made:</p>

<ul>
<li>not extending off of a base class</li>
<li>all dependencies are injected at run time</li>
<li>single-method for the class</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="identifying-dependencies">Identifying Dependencies</h2>

<p>So what are the dependencies I will need?</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a href="https://twig.symfony.com">Twig</a> object</li>
<li>a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">repository</a> object for retrieving data</li>
<li>a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html">view model</a> for presenting the data</li>
<li>an object that contains the HTTP <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/">request</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the old architecture, I was creating those dependencies deep inside the "business logic"
and therefore it was very hard to write anything other than some kind of "check
the HTML output" type of test. Ironically that is what the new test does as well but
this sort of decoupled architecture leads to a much more straightforward test.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-output">Identifying Output</h2>

<p>In these tests, I wanted to make sure that if I had at least one rotation
stored in the database for a particular week, when the page renders I should
see that rotation in the output somewhere.</p>

<h2 id="test-skeleton">Test Skeleton</h2>

<p>As always, I break out the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert">Arrange-Act-Assert</a> pattern
to create the skeleton of the test:</p>

<pre><code class="php">    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange

        // Act

        // Assert
        self::fail();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, you always want to start with a failing test.</p>

<h2 id="arranging-our-dependencies">Arranging our dependencies</h2>

<p>These days I try and use the fewest number of <a href="https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/test-doubles.html">test doubles</a>
in my test scenarios. Given the dependencies I needed,
I was going to need three "fake" dependencies, configured
to provide only the implementation details required to make
the scenario work.</p>

<p>I don't want to get into a longer discussion on the use of
test doubles except to say that the decoupling strategy
I am using will minimize the chances that any doubles drift
from how the code is actually implemented.</p>

<p>Trust me, I do this for a living!</p>

<pre><code class="php">    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange
        $loader = new FilesystemLoader(__DIR__ . '/../../templates/');
        $twig = new Environment($loader);

        $gamesRepo = $this-&gt;createMock(GameRepository::class);
        $gamesRepo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getMaxWeek')
            -&gt;willReturn(1);

        $testRotation = new ArrayCollection();
        $testRotation-&gt;add([
            'franchise_id' =&gt; 1,
            'ibl' =&gt; 'MAD',
            'rotation' =&gt; 'One, Two, Three'
        ]);

        $viewModel = $this-&gt;createMock(RotationsUsingDoctrine::class);
        $viewModel-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getAllByWeek')
            -&gt;willReturn($testRotation);

        $request = $this-&gt;createMock(Request::class);
        $request-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getQueryParams')
            -&gt;willReturn(['week' =&gt; 1]);

        // Act

        // Assert
        self::fail();
    }
</code></pre>

<h2 id="acting-on-the-code-under-test">Acting on the code-under-test</h2>

<p>This has always struck me as a weird way to describe "executing the
code we are testing" but I guess "Arrange-Execute-Assert" doesn't
flow in English quite the same way.</p>

<p>Now that I have all my dependencies created and configured the way
I need, time to run the code and grab some results I can test.</p>

<pre><code class="php">    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange

        // Act
        $query = new RotationManagementQuery($twig, $gamesRepo, $viewModel);
        $results = $query-&gt;__invoke($request);

        // Assert
        self::fail();
    }
</code></pre>

<h2 id="asserting-results-of-code-execution">Asserting results of code execution</h2>

<p>Just like I did before, I am checking the HTML output from executing
this Query to make sure I am seeing values that I expect</p>

<pre><code class="php">    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange

        // Act

        // Assert
        self::assertStringContainsString('One, Two, Three', $results-&gt;getBody());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>When building my assertions, I tend to go with "what are the
fewest number of things I need to do in order to prove the
code is working as expected."</p>

<p>In this case, I felt checking that I see an expected "pitching rotation"
in the output is good enough.</p>

<p>Here is what the whole test looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace Webreg\Test\Query;

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Slim\Psr7\Request;
use Twig\Environment;
use Twig\Loader\FilesystemLoader;
use Webreg\Query\RotationManagementQuery;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use Webreg\Repository\GameRepository;
use Webreg\ViewModel\RotationsUsingDoctrine;

class RotationManagementQueryTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange
        $loader = new FilesystemLoader(__DIR__ . '/../../templates/');
        $twig = new Environment($loader);

        $gamesRepo = $this-&gt;createMock(GameRepository::class);
        $gamesRepo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getMaxWeek')
            -&gt;willReturn(1);

        $testRotation = new ArrayCollection();
        $testRotation-&gt;add([
            'franchise_id' =&gt; 1,
            'ibl' =&gt; 'MAD',
            'rotation' =&gt; 'One, Two, Three'
        ]);

        $viewModel = $this-&gt;createMock(RotationsUsingDoctrine::class);
        $viewModel-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getAllByWeek')
            -&gt;willReturn($testRotation);

        $request = $this-&gt;createMock(Request::class);
        $request-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getQueryParams')
            -&gt;willReturn(['week' =&gt; 1]);

        // Act
        $query = new RotationManagementQuery($twig, $gamesRepo, $viewModel);
        $results = $query-&gt;__invoke($request);

        // Assert
        self::assertStringContainsString('One, Two, Three', $results-&gt;getBody());
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>Some thoughts that occur to me from looking at the final test:</p>

<ul>
<li>decoupling makes your dependencies quite visible during test creation</li>
<li>always make sure to only implement the behaviour of your test doubles that you need</li>
<li>your Arrange step will almost always be the largest part of any test</li>
<li>PHPUnit's built-in test double generators also act as assertions</li>
<li>sometimes the simplest way of verifying behaviour is what you should use</li>
</ul>

<p>From my perspective, decoupling the code allows me to focus on smaller
pieces of application behaviour, reducing the chances that a change in
this code breaks something somewhere else.</p>

            <link href="https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2022/01/05/solving-problems-with-profiling/"/>
            <updated>2022-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2022/01/05/solving-problems-with-profiling/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was presented with a problem that was occurring in the <a href="https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2021/12/30/repeatable-dev-environments/">virtual machine</a>
I was using for client development work -- the PHP-based acceptance test suite was running
extremely slowly. Normally it takes 12-13 minutes to run outside of the 
virtual machine but it was taking...54 minutes!</p>

<p>Because I am almost never afraid to ask for help, I bugged <a href="https://twitter.com/ocramius">Marco Pivetta</a>
to give me a hand, since he is working on the same client project. I figured if anyone knew of where to START diagnosing what
the problem is, it would be Marco.</p>

<p>Marco's suggestion after watching a smaller test suite run both in his
local environment and in my VM was that we should run the test suite
with a debugger enabled so we can see what is going on terms of resources
being consumed. For PHP, this usually means using <a href="https://xdebug.org">Xdebug</a>.</p>

<p>What Xdebug allows you to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://xdebug.org/docs/step_debug">step debugging</a></li>
<li>see better <code>var_dump()</code> information</li>
<li>write every function call to disk for later summarizing and reporting</li>
<li>profile your code to look for performance bottlenecks</li>
<li>generate code coverage when using PHPUnit (not sure if it works with other testing frameworks)</li>
</ul>

<p>I've used the step debugging feature a lot on unfamiliar
code bases but the profiling feature was definitely what we needed.</p>

<p>To ask Xdebug to profile the code we're testing, you need to have the
Xdebug extension installed and then tell <a href="https://phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a> that you want
to use it. The command to do it from your shell looks something like
this:</p>

<p><code>XDEBUG_MODE=profile vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=unit</code></p>

<p>Because our test environment was configured to run these tests using a specific
Docker container, I had to access the container directly via <code>docker-compose exec php-fpm</code>
and then execute this command inside the container.</p>

<p>This ran the test suite and generated a large number of <a href="https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html">cachegrind</a>
files. These files contain profiling data but you need a specialized
tool to read them and get information out of them that makes sense.
For Linux users you would likely want to use <a href="https://kcachegrind.github.io">KCachegrind</a>
but luckily for me you can read these files using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>.</p>

<p>The first step was to figure out which of these cachegrind files to 
examine. Unfortunately this is more intuition than science: our test
suite uses <code>@runInSeparateProcess</code> annotations so all the small ones
represent single tests. These are likely not to return any meaningful 
information. "Just pick the biggest one and let's see what happens."</p>

<p>So, we both opened up cachegrind files of similar sizes and took a look
at the data. What exactly where we looking for? In terms of bottlenecks
we can place things in either "network" or "CPU" categories. Is the application
waiting a lot for external resources (say, a service in a different container)
or is it waiting for the CPU to finishing doing something before it 
can continue.</p>

<p>Sadly, I cannot share the cachegrind output here as I have NDA's surrounding
the client work but the approach was:</p>

<ul>
<li>sort the calls by how much time was being spent on executing them</li>
<li>figure out if it is network or CPU</li>
</ul>

<p>For network issues, we were looking for things like time spent connecting
to a MySQL database in another container. As we scrolled through the list
at my end together we started noticing a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>network access wasn't the problem</li>
<li>we were spending an awful lot of time continually parsing a configuration file written using <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML</a> during bootstrap (ticket filed to fix this)</li>
<li>a lot of very simple PHP calls were taking significant amounts of CPU time</li>
</ul>

<p>The next step was to look at how much memory and CPU power I was giving to 
the virtual machine. I was giving it half my processing cores and half the
available memory. So that should not have been an issue.</p>

<p>Marco did some searching and found some forum posts of folks complaining about
how slow some VM's were in the latest version of <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMWare Fusion</a>
but their situation didn't seem to be the same as ours.</p>

<p>"Hrm, Chris, open up that 'Advanced Options' section in the 'Processors &amp; Memory' configuration
section. Aha!"</p>

<p>In that section were two disabled options, both dealing with running containers
inside the virtual machine. Given that we are heavily relying on Docker it definitely
made sense to enable those.</p>

<p>So I shut down the virtual machine, enabled those two options, and started it up.
Much to my surprise, the acceptance test suite now ran in 10 minutes instead of
54 minutes! Huge improvement and is also faster than how long it takes outside
of the virtual machine.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Marco was explaining to me how much Docker relies on having direct memory
access to things so not forcing those connections to go through a different path
in the VM would yield a huge gain. Now I'm happier with the performance of the test
suite.</p>

<p>So, in summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>the test suite was much slower than expected</li>
<li>a decision was made to run the test suite with Xdebug profiling enabled</li>
<li>we made an educated guess as to which profile output file to analyze</li>
<li>the profiling output led us to believe that there was a CPU-related bottleneck</li>
<li>the virtual machine had adequate memory and processor resources allocated to it</li>
<li>the VM was not configured to run containerized applications optimally</li>
<li>the VM has stopped and options pertaining to running containers inside the VM were enabled</li>
<li>re-running the test suite saw a huge increase in performance and execution time</li>
</ul>

<p>Without the ability to profile the code to get a better idea of where there might 
be problems, it would've taken a lot longer to come to an effective solution.</p>
