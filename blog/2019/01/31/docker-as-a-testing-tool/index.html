            <p>Yes, <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a> can be used as a tool to help
you out with some testing problems. Let me show an example of
how it makes some load testing easier.</p>

<p>One of the projects I support at <a href="https://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> is
the push notification service that we run. Among the tests that
I do for them is a load test using an <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autopush-loadtester">internal tool</a> 
that the developers of the service created. It is a <a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">Twisted</a> application that runs using <a href="https://pypy.org">PyPy</a>.</p>

<p>No, I do not know why they made those choices. Further more, it
doesn't matter because I have to use it so I roll with the weirdness.</p>

<p>Installing it locally on my MacBook Pro was straightforward --
the docs even cover expected weirdness with some support libraries.
But now that I have switched over to using Windows at work I
ran into some difficulties getting all the dependencies installed
in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, one of the developers uses Windows...and told me of
the experience he had at failing to get it to work. "I just use
VMWare Player and an Ubuntu VM".</p>

<p>I tried to get that working...and ran into a bunch of issues
where I had to disable something called "Windows Defender Credential Guard". Which bugged me because I like to keep security mechanisms in place
normally. I followed instructions FROM MICROSOFT on how to do it
and VMWare Player still wouldn't run. Kept giving me the same
error.</p>

<p>Okay, on to plan B -- Docker.</p>

<p>The first question was "how do I make this work?". I theorized
I needed to do something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>find a base container of Ubuntu 18</li>
<li>get inside a running version of that image</li>
<li>install all the required dependencies</li>
<li>verify that the load testing tool works</li>
<li>make a copy of that container</li>
<li>push that copy up to Docker hub for teammates to use</li>
</ul>

<p>Some searching revealed that I could get a running Ubuntu
container and connect with it:</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm --it ubuntu
</code></pre>

<p>This downloaded the image and gave me access to it via
a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a> shell.</p>

<p>With that shell, I started installing all the packages
I would need to install the load testing tool, including
adding the package repository for PyPy so I could install
it with the package manager.</p>

<p>Once I got all the dependencies installed, I made sure that
the tests could run. I even found out that there was a bug
in the documenation. ;)</p>

<p>With a Docker image that had a working installation of the
load testing tool, the next step turned out to be more
straight forward than I had thought.</p>

<p>The Docker feature I needed was called snapshots. Here is
what I did.</p>

<p>With the Docker container still running, I opened up
another shell (in this case I am using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">Powershell</a>) and used the command <code>docker ps</code>
to get the name that had been assigned by Docker to my
running container.</p>

<p>With that name I used the following command to save
a version of that container:</p>

<pre><code>docker commit name_of_container ubuntu:ap-loadtester 
</code></pre>

<p>Then I tagged the container so I can push up to Docker
hub under my account:</p>

<pre><code>docker tag ubuntu:ap-loadtester chartjes/ap-loadtester
</code></pre>

<p>Last, I pushed it up to Doker hub</p>

<pre><code>docker push chartjes/ap-loadtester
</code></pre>

<p>So now I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>an Ubuntu container I can share</li>
<li>that has all the dependencies installed</li>
<li>can be used by teammates to load test the push service</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, I emphasize that a tester with some programming
experience can create some really useful testing tools
by leveraging the same tools and environments used to
build whatever you are testing.</p>
