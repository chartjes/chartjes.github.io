        <div class="e-content">
            <p>For the first half of 2019 I was borrowed by the Performance Team
at Mozilla and asked to help them implement a way to measure the
performance of various browsers on Android platforms. This has
involved me getting familiar with several tools and environments
that I had not touched before:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mozilla's tooling for use with <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central">mozilla-central</a></li>
<li>Rooting Android devices for testing purposes</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/">Android Studio</a> and it's device emulation tools</li>
<li>Executing and parsing shell commands</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I am using <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a> as well to make sure
that I had thought about testing scenarios and giving whomever
supports this code once I am back at my previous role a chance
to figure out what is going on.</p>

<p>One of the testing scenarios I came up with was handing the fact that I
had designed the code to have a fallback mode in case the
shell command I was using did not work on that particular
device. Some code reviews from other developers revealed
some differences in how the <a href="https://www.unixtutorial.org/commands/top"><code>top</code> command</a>
works on different phones.</p>

<p>So, drawing  on my own experiences with using test
doubles in PHP, I asked myself "how can I create
a mock that has different return values?". In
pytest this functionality is called <code>side_effect</code>.</p>

<p>So, here is some of the code in question that I needed
to test:</p>

<pre><code class="python">try:
    cpuinfo = raptor.device.shell_output("top -O %CPU -n 1").split("\n")
    raptor.device._verbose = verbose
    for line in cpuinfo:
    data = line.split()
            if data[-1] == app_name:
                cpu_usage = data[3]
except Exception:
    cpuinfo = raptor.device.shell_output("dumpsys cpuinfo | grep %s" % app_name).split("\n")
    for line in cpuinfo:
        data = line.split()
        cpu_usage = data[0].strip('%')
</code></pre>

<p>I wrapped the first call in a try-catch construct because
an exception is thrown if anything is up with that <code>top</code>
call. If that call doesn't work, I then want to use that
<code>dumpsys</code> call.</p>

<p>In the test itself, I would need the <code>shell_output</code> call
to first throw an exception (as expected for the scenario)
and then return some output that I can then parse and use.</p>

<p>In the PHP world, most test doubling tools allow you to
create a mock and have it return different values on
consecutive calls. Pytest is no different, but it took
me a while to figure out the correct search terms to find
the functionality I wanted.</p>

<p>So, here is how I did it:</p>

<pre><code class="python">def test_usage_with_fallback():
    with mock.patch('mozdevice.adb.ADBDevice') as device:
        with mock.patch('raptor.raptor.RaptorControlServer') as control_server:
            '''
            First we have to return an error for 'top'
            Then we return what we would get for 'dumpsys'
            '''
            device.shell_output.side_effect = [
                OSError('top failed, move on'),
                ' 34% 14781/org.mozilla.geckoview_example: 26% user + 7.5% kernel'
            ]
            device._verbose = True

            # Create a control server
            control_server.cpu_test = True
            control_server.test_name = 'cpuunittest'
            control_server.device = device
            control_server.app_name = 'org.mozilla.geckoview_example'
            raptor = Raptor('geckoview', 'org.mozilla.geckoview_example', cpu_test=True)
            raptor.device = device
            raptor.config['cpu_test'] = True
            raptor.control_server = control_server

            # Verify the response contains our expected CPU % of 34
            cpuinfo_data = {
                u'type': u'cpu',
                u'test': u'usage_with_fallback',
                u'unit': u'%',
                u'values': {
                    u'browser_cpu_usage': '34'
                }
            }
            cpu.generate_android_cpu_profile(
                raptor,
                "usage_with_fallback")
            control_server.submit_supporting_data.assert_called_once_with(cpuinfo_data)
</code></pre>

<p>Let me break down what I did (as always, I am open to
suggestions on better ways to write this test).</p>

<p>The first double is for a class that communicates with the
Android device. Then the next double I needed was for the
"control server", which is what is used to control the
browser and execute tests.</p>

<p>My first "side effect" is to generate an error so it
triggers the first condition of the scenario that
'top should not work'. The second "side effect" is
the response I am expecting to get from the shell
command in my fallback area of the code.</p>

<p>Then I continue with the "arrange" part of the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert">Arrange-Act-Assert</a>
testing pattern I like to use -- I configure my
"control server" to be the way I want it.</p>

<p>I finish up with creating what I expect the data
that is to be submitted to our internal systems
looks like.</p>

<p>I execute the code I am testing (the "act" part)
and then use a <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/spy">spy</a>
to make sure the control server would have submitted
the data I was expecting to have been generated.</p>

<p>The ability to have a method return different values
is powerful in the context of writing tests for code
that has conditional behaviour. I hope you find this
example useful!</p>
