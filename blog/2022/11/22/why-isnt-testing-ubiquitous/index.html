            <p>Over on Twitter Mathias Verraes tweeted something that immediately 
triggered some feelings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Perhaps TDD isn't as ubiquitous as it should be because you
    can't make a business model out of it.
    (Original post on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/status/1595100145129263106">https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/status/1595100145129263106</a></p>
  </blockquote>

<p>I commented saying "Boy do I ever have feelings about this topic..." and
Matias asked me to share. I decided my response was better off as
a longer blog post. Don't worry, this will end up on Twitter / Mastodon
anyway.</p>

<p>He mentioned "observability" as a technique that ended up
being a very good business model. Why? In my opinion, figuring out
how to observe something in production is generic enough in that you
can create a tool and say "hey, add these stuff to your code or
production systems, and it will report stuff to this well-crafted
dashboard you can use to get an idea of what is going on."</p>

<p>I am a fan of these approach -- I highly recommend looking into
things like <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io">Honeycomb</a> to get an idea
of what you are signing up for when you choose that path.</p>

<p>So what about testing? Is testing generic enough that you could come
up with some kind of black box or external system that you can connect
your tests to and react to when things fail?</p>

<p>Tests are almost entirely bespoke. Dependent on architecture. Dependent
on environments. Heck, dependant on the skill of the people who have to
write and maintain them.</p>

<p>Also, in my experience, tests work best when you approach them from
the idea that they are there to make sure things are behaving as you
expect them to and to give you a way to determine if you've made changes
that have broken something elsewhere in your application.</p>

<p>In other words, chances are that a failing test is something that the
users of your application will never notice. They will notice broken
pages, non-functioning links, slow-to-respond interfaces. Those are things
that can probably be monitored through observability tools.</p>

<p>In a lot of cases you start off with the idea of having to add tests to
a system being adversarial. Developers don't want to spend the time
writing them. Management views them as tasks with little-to-no return
on investments. Clients balk at being told your bid is more expensive because
you are writing tests. Flaky tests reduce confidence. Build tools need
to be able to play nicely with your chosen testing tools. Effective
test suites can take a lot of time to create and maintain.</p>

<p>Not to mention almost nobody teaches people how to learn to use a programming
language from a test-centric perspective. I could not even imagine
how to teach a novice programmer how to use PHP while also showing them
how to use all the tools. Understanding my own target audience is developers-with-experience
has really changed how I teach and what I teach them.</p>

<p>Using an observability tool
can often be as simple as signing up for an online tool, follow their
directions on what needs to happen to monitor things, and then you
will know a lot faster when things aren't behaving correctly in
production.</p>

<p>Under those types of terms, testing will never be ubiquitous. Which
is a shame because it is a technique that can lead to stable code
bases and confident deployments to production.</p>

<p>Maybe someone out there with a different perspective will figure out
how to solve the stuff I talked about here. Until then, I am still happy
to help teach people how to add automated testing to their skill set
and hope they find it as useful as I have.</p>
