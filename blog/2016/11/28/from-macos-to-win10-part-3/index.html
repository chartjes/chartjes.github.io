            <h2 id="could-be-called-%27revenge-of-the-comfortable%27">Could Be Called 'Revenge Of The Comfortable'</h2>

<p>Welp, the Surface Book sat on my desk next to my MacBookAir in it's <a href="https://ca.hengedocks.com/">Henge Dock</a>
and didn't get used beyond Monday. I had some rough times with it that made
me retreat back into the comfortable arms of macOS.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2016/11/18/from-macos-to-win10-part-2">previous post</a>
I mentioned some things I had to take a look at. How did that go?</p>

<h3 id="needed-an-http-client-similar-to-paw">Needed an HTTP client similar to <a href="https://paw.cloud">Paw</a></h3>

<p>Ugh -- nothing I found was similar enough and I also encountered something
that became a recurring theme -- how much work did I want to do in order to
master a skill but using a different tool? The answer was "not much".</p>

<p>That's probably a personal failing but at age 45 I'm not sure how much time
I want to spend remapping those hard-fought memory mapped skills. I'm sure
you are starting to guess what the final conclusion might be.</p>

<h3 id="connect-to-external-monitor-and-keyboard">Connect To External Monitor And Keyboard</h3>

<p>I didn't bother pairing the bluetooth keyboard I'm currently typing on to
the Surface Book, but getting the monitor connected was. Multiple <em>hours</em>
spent trying to figure out what the problem was. Was it the drivers? Was it
my old monitor? What the hell was happening here -- mini display port to HDMI
works just fine on my Mac. In the end, it would only work when I used a
mini-display-port-to-VGA connector. It's 2016 and I was highly disappointed.</p>

<p>This then prompted another hour of me searching around looking at monitors
(hey, a 4K one sounds great) to discover it wouldn't work with my current
laptop and <em>might</em> not work correctly with a Surface Book (not all apps
scale properly).</p>

<h3 id="better-hosts-file-management">Better Hosts File Management</h3>

<p>"Just edit it with Notepad" -- said by people that never used <a href="http://gas-mask.apponic.com/mac/">Gas Mask</a></p>

<h3 id="battery-life-is-weird">Battery Life Is Weird</h3>

<p>One of the reasons I thought the Surface Book would be enticing is I could
detach the screen and use it as a tablet. That actually worked okay...but I
would run low on battery after about an hour of usage. That is way less than
what my ancient iPad 3 gives me.</p>

<p>I don't really use my laptop much unplugged, but a tablet that has really
poor battery life isn't that great.</p>

<h3 id="maybe-the-best-change-is-no-change">Maybe The Best Change Is No Change</h3>

<p>Look, I know people are going to think I'm weak-willed about this. Yes, the Win10
platform has made leaps and bounds. I did find it jarring to use, and I was
actually able to do everything I needed to do at my day job with it. Bash
on Win10 worked great (except for curl not working correctly). Atom was a
more than suitable editor. Firefox works just fine on Win10. I could do
most of what I want to do on Win10. But I would have to relearn a bunch of
tools. I'm not sure I want to do that.</p>

<p>I have to give back the Surface Book when I get back from a work meeting in
Hawaii (yes, sucks to be me) in a few weeks, so the decision is far from over.
One review I read said <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-week-with-the-new-macbook-pro-with-touch-pad-126eebb89ac#.tfcsz7pap">don't get it if you have a newish MBP</a> while another felt that Apple had
<a href="https://medium.com/@ageitgey/the-new-macbook-pro-is-kind-of-great-for-hackers-64c1c577a4d2#.1a7jc5ck3">built a great machine for hackers</a>.</p>

<p>Where does this leave someone with a 4-1/2 year old (that's 45 years in
internet time) MacBook Air? Even more confused than before.</p>

<p>I don't need the Touch Bar because my laptop will run in clamshell/lid-closed
mode approximately 99% of the time. What I really wanted was a MacBook
that has 32 GB of RAM. I can't get that right now. But will there be one
available in April? I would be super-pissed if that happened after I bought
a 16GB one.</p>

<p>I'm still more indecisive about it than ever.</p>
