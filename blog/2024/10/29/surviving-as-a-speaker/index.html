            <p>I just got back from speaking at <a href="https://cascadiaphp.com">CascadiaPHP</a>
and wanted to share some thoughts about how I approach going to conferences
as a speaker and maybe you will find it helpful too.</p>

<h3 id="you-are-playing-a-dual-role">You are playing a dual role</h3>

<p>I have been going to conferences since 2003 and speaking at them since 2005.
That is a very long time, spanning the vast majority of my professional
career. Most of my energy and attention are devoted to making sure that
I deliver the best talk I can at the time I give it.</p>

<p>I also need to show other attendees that I still have things to learn so
I make sure to go to other talks.</p>

<p>I understand that for some folks time pressures are such that they come in,
give a talk, and then immediately leave. I am not a fan of that approach and
would never do it -- I would just simply decline the opportunity. But for
many events they are marketed as an opportunity to get access to some of
the most knowledgeable people in your programming community. So I feel
you should give back by making sure to talk to other people, make some
new community friends, and encourage people to continue to attend these
events.</p>

<p>So make sure to support your other speakers by attending their talks. I
know I missed some talks at CascadiaPHP because I was not handling
the 3-hour time difference well and I was catching up with some old friends
during other talks. I did get to some talks of things I was interested in
and that is really what we are here for.</p>

<h3 id="know-your-material">Know your material</h3>

<p>I will admit that I often don't practice my talks because I make sure I
really know the material before I present. I think I can mostly get away
with this because of my presentation style -- it is kind of like walking
a tightrope.</p>

<p>So even if you can't practice your talk a lot, if you understand the
material really well then a collection of slides that act as the initial
thoughts you want to go over, and then you fill in the rest yourself
makes for really engaging talks.</p>

<h3 id="answer-questions-and-ask-questions">Answer questions and ask questions</h3>

<p>This can be hard for people who suffer from "imposter syndrome". My joke
about this is that my ego is too large for me to think I am an imposter,
but the truth is I am highly confident that I can figure out how to do
just about anything. The key to pulling that off is to understand when
you don't know something and then figure out who you can ask for help.</p>

<p>In the context of a conference, I try to do talks that question the
way some things are, present my point of view, and then ask the audience
to consider what I've told them. You don't have to agree with everything
I say (talks that like that are boring) but I do actually change my mind
over time and with experience. So try and get your audience thinking
and wanting to ask questions.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you are watching someone else's talk and don't understand
what is going on, ask them a question if you can. I generally ask people
to save their questions for the end of my talks but feel free to go with
whatever feels right for you.</p>

<p>A great example of this is the topic of <a href="https://phpstan.org/blog/generics-by-examples">generics in PHP</a>. I have never
used them and have not been able to figure out on my own why they might
be useful to me. There was a talk about <a href="https://phpstan.org">PHPStan</a>
and they mentioned generics. I didn't ask the speaker about them as
I got to the end so instead I asked some of my fellow developers if
they could explain to me why I should care about them. They provided
me with some insights into when and where I might want to use them
so next time I am building something that could benefit from Generics,
I will give it a try.</p>

<p>If I hadn't asked, a question I probably would still be thinking they were something
I would not have to worry about.</p>

<h3 id="take-care-of-yourself">Take care of yourself</h3>

<p>Make sure to eat.</p>

<p>Make sure to get proper amounts of rest.</p>

<p>Don't treat the conference like it's an excuse to cut loose and abuse yourself.</p>

<p>I don't want to say things like "be a professional" because that on it's own
is really insulting. Instead, be respectful towards yourself.</p>

<h3 id="have-your-slides-done-ahead-of-time">Have your slides done ahead of time</h3>

<p>There is the trope of folks doing their slides at the last minute. In almost
every case I have my slides all done before I come to the event, This time
I ended up needing to devote the time I would've spent on slides for one
of my presentations doing stuff around my house getting it ready to be sold.
I ended up finishing the slides in my hotel room during a block of talks
that I did not find interesting enough to attend.</p>

<h3 id="sometimes-the-talk-just-doesn%27t-work">Sometimes the talk just doesn't work</h3>

<p>This final one is tricky. Sometimes, a talk just doesn't resonate with the
audience. You miscalculated how much time you had. You wanted to talk theory
but the audience was expecting examples. You only prepared 30 minutes when
the slot was an hour. It was the first time you gave the talk. It happens.
I view them as teachable lessons about what the audience is expecting from
you, which becomes even more important if you are lucky enough to have
a long enough speaking career where there are expectations that you are
going to be a certain way.</p>

<p>We can all learn from our challenges -- failing to do so is the real issue.</p>

<h3 id="you-made-it%21">You made it!</h3>

<p>If you want to an event and spoke, congratulations! Now try and make the
experience for your audience and yourself just a little bit better next time.</p>
