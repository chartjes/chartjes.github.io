            <h1 id="return-on-investment-on-updating-dependencies">Return on Investment on Updating Dependencies</h1>

<p>This week I came across two separate posts that seem to
defy what a lot of terminally-online PHP developers have
embraced as common practices:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://alexcabal.com/posts/standard-ebooks-and-classic-web-tech">How Standard Ebooks serves millions of requests per month</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/wiki/Development-Guide#maintaining-security-and-laravel-no-upgrade-policy">Freescout's Maintaining Security and Laravel No-Upgrade Policy</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="building-things-with-boring-technology">Building things with boring technology</h2>

<p>The Ebooks blog post is a great primer on how to build something awesome
that serves the needs of users without relying on new web application
frameworks that have a lot of dependencies and features that you aren't
going to need. A lot of thought clearly went into "how can we provide
our users with value by using the minimum amount of code and system
resources". Definitely an approach more developers should embrace.</p>

<p>It also emphasizes a point I have been trying to make to programmers: the
people who USE your application will absolutely not care what you are building
it with. What you use is an implementation detail, and the biggest problem
you will face is finding people who can continue to use your chosen implementation
details and keep the application going.</p>

<p>I am going to guess that of the most common scripting languages out there,
PHP is one of the easier ways to accomplish this task. A language born of
the web, with a lot of web-centric functionality as part of it's standard
library, can be used by developers who are familiar with how the web actually
works.</p>

<p>Alex Cabal talks about how when he wants to build something for the web, he
reaches for PHP. Setting aside the obvious conclusion that people who know
PHP well don't hesitate to use it, the only point where he seems to deviate
from my own thoughts is on using web application frameworks.</p>

<p>In his post he calls them "scaffolding that he doesn't want to ever see again"
while I feel like they are the foundation on which you will be forced to
build everything else on.</p>

<p>Sure, you can either use the front-controller pattern implemented in a
framework that intercepts each call and figures out what to do next...or
you can tell Apache to do the same thing. Clearly, the Apache approach
is the "old school" way while most frameworks supply a convention you
need to follow.</p>

<p>I also like the imaginative use of Git to replace the "M" part of the
"LAMP stack" (Linux-Apache-MySql-PHP for those not familiar with the term)
and furthermore the use of storing all their data in memory instead
of the file system.</p>

<p>It's very clear that the folks at Standard Ebooks clearly understand both
the domain and the problems they are trying to solve. It's also very clear
that they learned to write PHP code long before the current situation of
two dominant frameworks pushing new ideas.</p>

<p>Boring is good. Boring allows you to go home on time and also find solutions
to your problems that were created a decade ago.</p>

<h2 id="the-costs-of-updating">The costs of updating</h2>

<p>I have two very long-running PHP applications on the web: one was built using
<a href="https://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> and the other is free-form PHP that I am slowly
migrating towards having some structure using <a href="https://slimframework.com">Slim</a>.
So I am familiar with not only updating the underlying dependencies AND with
having to have enough actual knowledge of how the web works to write code that
does not heavily rely on a framework (side note: I think the <a href="https://php-fig.org">PHP Standards Recommendations Project</a> is an unjustly-maligned resource for building web applications).</p>

<p>The post from the Freescout folks is a slightly different. In it, they boldly
state that they see no need to update the base framework they used to build
the application. They have instead chosen to update "vendor packages" -- meaning
they are patching the original code provided via Composer.</p>

<p>Their reasoning is similar to what the Ebooks folks are thinking -- the constant
reality of having to update your framework components and (possibly) support
libraries is real. Now, I could argue that with a good test suite in place this
does become a non-issue but I do not know the state of the test suite for either
application.</p>

<p>I do know that it certainly feels like more work to go through dependencies
written by other developers and apply your own custom patches to them. Then
you are stuck maintaining your own custom version of your dependencies.</p>

<p>I don't know -- perhaps I am just lazy and I am more than willing to suffer
the pain of upgrading my dependencies for security fixes or new features
the developers of the framework want you to embrace. Good test suites are
the key and in the absence of them, I hesitate to both do the work myself
or trust the folks writing the application I am using that "we haven't had
any security issues".</p>

<p>Agian, much like in the case of Standard Ebooks, my thoughts on the approach
the Freescout team is taking isn't wildly different or even disparaging.
I just prefer to use other tools to let me know when I need to fix a problem.</p>

<h2 id="takeways">Takeways</h2>

<p>First, don't hesitate to build things with "boring" tools that you understand
well. Your users will literally not care.</p>

<p>Second, there are at a high level two "costs" to using a framework you will have to deal
with. The first is how hard is it to embrace the conventions it uses. The
second is how often are you going to have to devote time and effort to
update both the framework and it's dependencies.</p>

<p>Third, tests are a great tool you can use to find out what breaks and/or
no longer works as expected when you update dependencies.</p>
