        <div class="e-content">
            <p>I've never been one to stop looking at new tools and figuring
out if they can be applied to the work I do. When do I find
interesting things, I like to talk about them a little and share.
Here's what I've been looking at in January 2024.</p>

<h2 id="laravel">Laravel</h2>

<p>Yes, the artisanal elephant in the room. At my <a href="https://ziffdavis.com">current job</a>
we are all-in on using Laravel. Which means not only learning 
how Laravel does things but evaluating every additional choices
through the lense of "are we going to end up fighting the framework
if we do it this way."</p>

<p>I prefer not to fight. Honestly, it's fine. People are having a
very hard time separating how they feel about the people behind
the tools from the tools themselves. There will always be things to
dislike about any web application framework.</p>

<h2 id="aws">AWS</h2>

<p>A enterprise level company with a large web presence relies heavily
on the cloud? THIS IS MY SHOCKED FACE.</p>

<p>I don't really have to worry much about going into an AWS console
to do something, but I am having to learn about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/">SQS</a>
and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/financial-services/partner-solutions/snowflake/">Snowflake</a>.
More importantly, I get to flex some skills behind building things
that implement interfaces because my work projects will be dealing
with multiple types of queues and multiple data storage back end.</p>

<p>Sometimes code architecture matters instead of being a way for
bored or self-centered-while-misinformed developers to express
themselves.</p>

<h2 id="helix">Helix</h2>

<p>I am a big fan of modal editors as it is very hard to bulid a
keyboard-centric editor without modes. After seeing some <a href="https://neovim.io">NeoVim</a>
folks say nice things about it, I decided to take a look at <a href="https://helix-editor.com">Helix</a>
and see if it is something I could migrate towards.</p>

<p>Lots to like here! Integration with <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">language servers</a>
and <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">Tree-sitter</a> along
with being customizable to a certain extent via configuration
files. No plugin architecture yet though.</p>

<p>The show-stopper for me was that it does not have good <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/">Debug Anywhere Protocol</a> support, which means I could not get <a href="https://xdebug.org">Xdebug</a>
working with it. Not being able to use an interactive debugger is a
show stopper for me now. Sorry.</p>

<h2 id="hypermedia">Hypermedia</h2>

<p>I talked about it briefly in <a href="https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2024/01/21/wait-long-enough/">another post here</a>
but I feel like taking a closer look at hypermedia and
acceptable patterns for it might yield some interesting results
in my personal projects. Again, I highly encourage you to
take a look at <a href="https://hypermedia.systems/">Hypermedia Systems</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bootstrap-css">Bootstrap CSS</h2>

<p>CSS and all the associated frameworks is something I also avoided
over the years. My journey into <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> and hypermedia
also made me take a look at the state of CSS frameworks. My longest-running
project used a very old version of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> so
rather than pull it all out and replace it with something like
<a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a> (which my brain is having a
hard time wrapping itself around for whatever reason) I'm just back
to older, more stable tools.</p>

<p>When it comes to tools that I do not have a lot of experience with,
I always need a reduced number of choices. Once I've mastered things more
then I appreciate the extensibility and flexibility some tools offer.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>After reading this post you should learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>I still like modal editors</li>
<li>I am constantly looking at tools and languages and frameworks for suitability and ease-of-use</li>
<li>sometimes the old ways were actually better instead of triggering nostalgia</li>
</ul>
