            <h2><div class="p-name">Thoughts On Mentoring</div> <small>post</small></h2>
        </header>
        <div class="e-content">
            <p>Stick around in this industry and you realize that once you
pick a "community", it is quite small. At my current position
with <a href="https://shoppinginsights.ziffdavis.com">Ziff Davis Shopping</a>
my manager is someone who I formally mentored for almost a year
back in the mid 2010's. I really enjoyed sharing my experiences
with him (and another person who became a good friend I never
get to see often enough) as we talked about career goals and how
to make that transition from "programming as a job" to "programming
as a career".</p>

<p>As I am in my early days of being a Staff Software Engineer, a big 
part of the position is a leadership one. Not only am I supposed to
be turning business requirements (and infrastructure requirements)
into code, the decisions I make and the patterns I choose trickle
down to the rest of the team.</p>

<p>Now it may surprise people who have been lulled by my very effective
marketing that the so-called Grumpy Programmer always has lots and
lots of time to give to other programmers who want to learn things
and discuss my work, their work, and how it might fit together.</p>

<p>Since I do enjoy repeatable patterns, here are some things I think
are both repeatable and can lead to success.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-can%27t-explain-it%2C-don%27t-use-it">If You Can't Explain It, Don't Use It</h2>

<p>This is generally good advice for people who want to start giving
talks at conferences (come to Chicago at the end of April and see
me talk about CQRS and how to configure NeoVim to be a PHP IDE at
<a href="https://tek.phparch.com">php[tek] 2024</a>) and even more important
in the workplace.</p>

<p>This is why I try and lean on using established software development
patterns and working as close to the conventions the tools I am using
are expecting. Again, life is too short to fight your software.</p>

<p>Work really hard to only use solutions you can teach other people to
use. I feel like my personal strategy of "small units of code, following
an explainable structure, snapped together like LEGO" is one I can
easily explain.</p>

<h2 id="stop-assuming-everyone-knows-what-you-do">Stop Assuming Everyone Knows What You Do</h2>

<p>This can be hard to do without coming across as condescending or ignorant
but it is critical. "I am using the Repository pattern to create some
classes to talk to the database? Have you used it before?" is a great
example of how to handle it.</p>

<p>I learn something new almost every day from my colleagues, no matter their
levels of experience or perceived skill. I have also found the great side
effect of allowing me to embrace the idea of "what you are doing is complicated
and I don't quite understand it.".</p>

<p>Just because I am a "staff engineer" doesn't mean I understand everything.
I understand enough to prototype and make spikes and then dig deeper for
answers. Never confuse someone not knowing something with them not being
good at their job. I certainly wasn't formally taught design patterns
when I entered the industry in the late 1990's.</p>

<h2 id="embrace-teaching">Embrace Teaching</h2>

<p>Pair with people. Seek feedback on your work. Submit work-in-progress draft
pull requests. Emphasize the parts of your work you are not sure about.
Reiterate the parts that have been successful for others.</p>

<p>I also highly encourage you to embrace the idea of "be the type of co-worker
or leader that you wish you'd had early in your career". I didn't have
anyone mentoring me, so I stumbled around making a lot of mistakes
while ignoring early advice from people that they saw leadership
qualities in me (I have a whole talk ready to go about this if you're
ever interested in having me do a keynote).</p>

<h2 id="take-pride-in-helping">Take Pride In Helping</h2>

<p>Look, I know the phrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership">servant leadership</a>
is trendy but the message it it's roots is that as a leader, your job
is to serve the needs of the group you are leading. If you look at it
from the angle of mentoring, your job is to help the people you mentoring
get better. Heck, I try and help people to become better than me.</p>

<p>You never know when you might need help and it's good to know you've
created a network of goodwill around yourself.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>After reading this you should learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have mentored people in the past</li>
<li>I have enjoyed watching them grow into successful careers</li>
<li>teaching is something I find enjoyable</li>
<li>take pride in having helped people</li>
</ul>
