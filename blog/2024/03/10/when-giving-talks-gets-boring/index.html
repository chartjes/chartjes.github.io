        </header>
        <div class="e-content">
            <p>Over on federated social media, my long-time programming
friend (and former JavaScript developer meetup organizer)
<a href="https://hachyderm.io/@dcousineau">Daniel Cousineau</a> had 
a multi-post thread lamenting the demise of the "tech meetup"
and was wondering what to do about it?</p>

<p>Daniel's thoughts on this caused me to reflect on my years
of doing developer advocacy via speaking at conferences and
meetups. I've been doing it since 2016 and, well, I know this
sounds weird but I got bored and decided to do it a lot less.</p>

<p>Just before we occupied the current Fortress of Grumpitude back
in 2017, I had been basically going full-throttle with career-related
travl. When February 2018 rolled around, I had just finished
a streak of getting on a plane for work or to speak at an event
for 36 straight months. The evil Facebook reminded me that in 
2016 I spoke in Autralia, Serbia, England, and Chicago all before
the end of July. Not to mention travelling at least twice a year
for Mozilla events.</p>

<p>I was tired and wanted a change. I had also grown weary of talking
about testing. Sure, it was my thing. But there were so many other
things I was interested in talking about and sharing. So by
conference attendance dropped to doing one talk a year basically.
Then the pandemic started and there were a few random online
events I participated in.</p>

<p>Still didn't feel very satisfied. Still was super bored.</p>

<p>Then I made the decision when I attended Longhorn PHP 2022 that
I was not going to do any testing talks any more. I did a three
hour talk that attempted to summarize everything I had gone
through on my journey to becoming on of the most vocal and (for a
time) well-known PHP testing evangelists.</p>

<p>Then I went to php|tek in Chicago in 2023 not as an attendee, but
to volunteer at the booth for <a href="https://osmihelp.org">OSMI</a> -- Open
Sourcing Mental Illness. My good friend Ed Finkler started up
this non-profit and it continues to do unappreciated work in
the programming community. It was close enough that I could drive.
Flying would've been about 6.5 hours door-to-door -- the drive
in my MuskMobile was about 8.5 hours with stops for meals and
charging. A lot cheaper than flying though. The weather was great,
the miles slowly piled up, and I got to hang out with a lot of
my friends for the first time in a long time.</p>

<p>It was great to sit in a booth and not feel any pressure to deliver
talks. Not that I had felt pressure in a long time, but it is still
a non-trivial amount of work to come up with a talk. Deciding on
material, creating slides, practicing the talk (although after
many years of public speaking I can often improvise).</p>

<p>I still have the desire to share, to advocate for things I find
interesting. So I decided if I was going to do talks again on
my once-a-year schedule, they were going to be on my terms.</p>

<p>Luckily, I can still write talk proposals that get accepted. I
will once again be speaking at php|tek 2024. I will be driving
there again in the MuskMobile, but a long-time friend who has
never been to Chicago is going to come with me and we'll do
some touristy stuff and then he can wander off to do his own
thing while I speak.</p>

<p>So, what did I decide to do to keep things from being boring?
By making my talks stealth talks.</p>

<p>I'm giving two talks -- one about Command-Query Responsibility
Segregation (CQRS) and configuring NeoVim to be a PHP IDE.</p>

<p>The CQRS talk is really going to be a stealh talk about
paying attention to design patterns. I was asked on Mastodon
for my thoughts on what I felt self-taught programmers were
missing out on compared to those who actually studied computer
science. Being half self-taught (I want to college for computer
studies but before the rise of the web) I could share I felt
self-taught folks tended to reinvent things and to ignore
design patterns.</p>

<p>So I want to teach the audience about design patterns and
cover the ones you are most likely to encounter in their
work building web applications.</p>

<p>The second talk about configuring NeoVim for PHP use is
actually a stealth talk about choosing and matering tools.
I have been a Vim (and now NeoVim user) for many years.
In fact, pretty much every blog post here was written
using Vim or NeoVim. I've used it a lot for PHP development.
But getting to know how to use Vim taught me the importance
of mastering your chosen tools to get the results you 
want faster.</p>

<p>So, I want to suggest strategies for choosing your tools
and some deliberate approaches I have tried that seem to
have worked. I use PhpStorm for most of my PHP work these
days due to great third-party tool integration, but with
Vim keybindings activated. I then use NeoVim for everything
else.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>Even though the benefits to both me personally and my career
were immense, I grew bored of giving conference talks. Now
I am determined to do them a lot less but under my own terms.</p>

<p>Maybe I will see some of you in Chicago the last week of
April 2024?</p>
