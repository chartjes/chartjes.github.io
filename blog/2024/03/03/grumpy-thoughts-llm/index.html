            <h2><div class="p-name">A Grumpy Programmer&#039;s Thoughts On LLM</div> <small>post</small></h2>
        </header>
        <div class="e-content">
            <p>I know that I have had a lot of harsh words to say about
"AI" and LLM's lately on my Mastodon account. I thought
I would do a longer piece here on my blog since endless
threads on Mastodon are no substitute for longer-form
writing. Besides, I haven't blogged in two weeks and already
broke my promise to myself of weekly posts here.</p>

<p>Anyway, onwards.</p>

<h2 id="we%27re-being-bamboozled">We're Being Bamboozled</h2>

<p>First off, let's get my main objection out of the way. This
is not Artificial Intelligence in any way, shape, or form.
It is the triumph of marketing and people desperate to grab
dynastic wealth for themselves.</p>

<p>Large Language Models are, in my opinion, very cool technology.
Their ability to take some text written in a more natural language
and generate some output from them is really good. Writing
parsers and interpreters is hard. Making one where the language
you use is not full of weird syntax is even harder.</p>

<p>No, the real issue is that a bunch of people who want to get rich
enough so they never have to interact with us are lying. This is
not artificial intelligence. It is a stochastic parrot, stringing
words together that sound reasonable but very often are full of
shit and not what we asked for.</p>

<p>Since our industry is full of unserious, mediocre people who
think they are competent and serious, the full-press marketing
effort to convince the people who make decisions at companies
across all sorts of industry that "AI is here to make you
easy profits!!!!" is on.</p>

<p>I am not the first person to point out that while the technology
has not gotten to the point where so many people can be replaced
by an LLM, way too many CEO's and other senior leadership have
been convinced that it has reached that point.</p>

<p>The outcome of this is going to be disastrous for any leaders
who have not already figured out how to ensure their compensation
is not tied to the actual performance of their companies.</p>

<h2 id="we%27re-being-told-stealing-is-okay-if-money-is-good">We're Being Told Stealing Is Okay If Money Is Good</h2>

<p>I was there when Napster became a thing. It was awesome to be able
to find all sorts of music you liked and download it to your computer.
I also remember how the music industry freaked out and intended
to sue people for millions of dollars for downloading one song.</p>

<p>As with everything, this freakout was because they had not figured out
a way of making money off the renting of music to people. In our streaming
world, our fate has been sealed -- it is becoming harder and harder to
own "physical" copies of popular items, especially film and music.</p>

<p>But for this new business model of providing natural language prompts that
take our questions and respond with useful answers to work and make monopoly
profits for all involved, they have to read in as much information as possibly
to train their systems. This also means they are brazenly reading in all
sorts of material they do not have permissions to do so.</p>

<p>Then, with a straight face, they tell us we must let them do it or else.</p>

<p>Look, for many years I posted content for free all over the internet. My old
blog (of which the archives are part of this one) and thousands and thousands
of posts to Twitter and Facebook. I understood that as long as I was deliberately
making these posts publicly, I was okay with other people slicing and dicing up
the content.</p>

<p>This is the main premise of the internet I joined and embraced in the early 2000's.</p>

<p>However, I have produced content for which I have been paid. Multiple books, conference
talks, and videos for sale. I am 99.999% sure that books and videos I have created
were slurped up by one of these companies. I did not give them permission. But
given how favourable the US legal system is towards corporations (plus the fact
that I live in Canada) the chances of me getting any kind of compensation for them
making unauthorized copies of what I created is pretty much zero.</p>

<p>They are, from my perspective, thieves wearing business suits or hoodies, depending
on your mental image of what you think an "AI" business owner looks like.</p>

<p>Fuck you, pay me.</p>

<h2 id="scraping-used-to-be-okay">Scraping Used To Be Okay</h2>

<p>To head off some more popular arguments, yes, search engines could not exist without
people giving permission for their content to be scanned, summarized, and categorized.
Again, I am okay with this since by posting my things publicly I gave permission
for this.</p>

<p>It is pretty much impossible to become a programmer with a broad range of skills if
you do not have search engines that accurately answer your prompts. We have questions.
We do not necessarily work or are in close contact with people who have answers. So we
go online and search for those answers.</p>

<p>For a long time, search engines were useful. Then Google, flush with cash and convinced
that having created one incredibly technology, could do anything it wanted. So it used
their incredibly search engine and plastered it with ads to make money. But failure
after failure caused them to lean more and more onto what was now an advertising platform
with a side effect of providing some answers to questions.</p>

<p>Someone much smarter than me has pointed out that LLM's help create the illusion that
so many grifters and non-technical people wanted to believe: that ideas are what mattered
instead of the ability to execute on those ideas.</p>

<p>There is a reason the stereotype of the "bro with an idea who justs needs a technical
person to implement it" persists.</p>

<p>Now, LLM folks believe if we will just shut the hell up and let them steal everything
that isn't nailed down (and take a lot of stuff that is nailed down but nobody is actively
watching) they will no longer need the implementers. Their grand ideas will finally
see the light of day. More importantly, they won't have to share the money with anybody else.</p>

<p>I will not willingly help these people. I am not some cog in their wheel of ambition.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-llm%27s-are-good-for%3F">Is There Anything LLM's Are Good For?</h2>

<p>Of course there are.</p>

<p>One of my co-workers has started using a service called Otter to take transcripts of our meetings at work
so they have reference material. There is nothing revolutionary about taking notes for meetings to
use later. However, it is not a replacement for not attending the meeting. Too many folks
are presenting it as such. Come to the damn meeting and stop acting like you are too
special to be here and discuss the issues with us.</p>

<p>LLM's are providing a lot of value to people as tools to help them solve coding issues.
I am not using them out of choice but I suspect there may come a time when search engines become
enshittified enough that I will have to resort to an LLM to provide me with the skeleton
of solutions to my problems. These sort of tools are nothing more than fancy autocomplete.
There will not be a time any time soon where I can feed it a list of requirements for
a web application and it will create one that works flawlessly and does not need
maintenance.</p>

<p>As a tool for applying a vast number of changes to a code base in a short period of time,
they will be awesome. As a tool to replace someone who understands how to turn natural
language requirements into code? No chance. But too many greedy business owners have
bought the hype and believe they are. I look forward to seeing those businesses suffer
the consequences of poor management.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>So, what can we really do?</p>

<p>Well, I think people who work in this industry
like I do can stop hyping it as a replacement for problem solving
and critical thought. These systems do not learn from their mistakes.
They will just keep making them over and over again.</p>

<p>I also feel it is critical to not turn a blind eye to
the fact that these companies are asking us to allow them,
for free, to slurp up everything they find online in an attempt
to sell it back to us.</p>

<p>Given how they fought to have anyone who touched anything that
belonged to them, do not let them off the hook now that stealing
stuff is their best interests.  A lot of these companies have already
been stealing wages from you. Don't let them take anything else.</p>

<p>Finally, understand that being a luddite doesn't mean that you
hate technology -- you hate the exploitation of people via the
use of technology.</p>

<p>Band together. Don't let companies treat you like garbage. Don't
believe the AI hype. This is another bubble and the companies that
are choosing to make the bubble their identity will fail.</p>
