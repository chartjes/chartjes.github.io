            <h2 id="spoiled-by-xdebug%3F">Spoiled by Xdebug?</h2>

<p>For all the insults that PHP catches, one that seems to
never come up is how good <a href="https://xdebug.org">Xdebug</a> is
for figuring out what might be going on in an application.</p>

<p>I have been porting over a Python web app that is used to
trigger a batch processing job that validates online purchases.
I have been rewriting parts of it in PHP + Laravel + queue workers
and as part of the testing, I was trying to figure out why I
could not trigger the batch processing properly.</p>

<p>I have been spoiled by being able to use Xdebug to figure out
what is going on with my PHP applications, but had never used
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">Python's debugger</a>.</p>

<p>Since I am a happy <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm">PhpStorm</a> user
I figured I should also use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm">PyCharm</a>
to do my Python dev work. I figured they were similar enough that it
wouldn't be painful to debug.</p>

<p>As an aside, learning how to use a debugger for your preferred programming
language will give you real productivity gains. No more <code>die('here')</code> statements
in your code.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-work-in-python%3F">How does this work in Python?</h2>

<p>So, having no experience with Python debugging I ass-u-me'd that it would
be behaving similar to how Xdebug does things:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure you have a version of Python with debugger support</li>
<li>it sends messages out on a specific port</li>
<li>tell the IDE to listen</li>
<li>set your breakpoint</li>
<li>wait for the nice debugger output to come up</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, dear friends, this is not how it worked at all. I was stumped and
wondering "why doesn't it work like Xdebug?!?". Which is, of course,
silly. It was just my assumptions that were wrong.</p>

<p>I spent some time doing online searches with all sorts of variations
on how to debug Python apps in PyCharm. Lots of interesting and
helpful blog posts...none of which covered what I was trying to do.</p>

<p>I asked on federated social media for some help -- again, some helpful
advice but I got variations of "don't try it that way". Now, that is
well-intentioned but not really an answer.</p>

<p>I had a web app, running locally inside a Python virtual environment. This
shouldn't be hard. I was starting to think that the issue was that I was
not using the same terms as everyone else.</p>

<p>With a running app, I kept wondering "so how do I continually restart the
application to turn on the debugger" as that seemed to me at the time
the only solution for the issue.</p>

<p>Clearly, I was doing it wrong.</p>

<p>While doing some more random searches, I finally stumbled across something
that turned out the be the solution. In a blog post (sorry, I did not
bookmark it) about debugging another Python web application the person
said "...and just attach the debugger to a running process".</p>

<p>Apologies to people who might not get the reference, but if you've ever
seen an image of a person thinking about something and then a light bulb
goes on over head? That is what it was like.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-by-attaching-to-a-running-process">Debugging by attaching to a running process</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that these details are while using PyCharm 2024.1.4 (Professional Edition).
So, in my situation I had this:</p>

<ul>
<li>project is configured in PyCharm to use the Python interpreter in my virtual environment</li>
<li>the application is running</li>
<li>I have set a breakpoint in my Python code</li>
</ul>

<p>Inside PyCharm I went to <code>Run &gt; Attatch to Process</code> and was presented with
some Python processes along with their process ID (I'm on MacOS). I selected the
one for my application and then made my request to the web app to turn
start the batch processing and it worked! I could now
debug things inside and figure out how things are working.</p>

<p>Hope this helps folks who are less-familiar with Python and it's
debugging capabilities get up to speed faster.</p>
