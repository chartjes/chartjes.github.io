        </header>
        <div class="e-content">
            <p>My co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/chipersoft">Jarvis</a> wrote a blog post
about how he <a href="http://chipersoft.com/p/I-Dont-Care-About-Your-Culture/">doesn't care about your company culture</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know what prompted this blog post, but I disagree with many fundamental
parts of it. Jarvis seems like a decent guy (have only met him online and not
yet in person) but I think Jarvis is making a mistake that many people (not
just software developers) make: thinking that the rest of the world should
think like you when it clearly doesn't.</p>

<p>Initially I was going to make a point-by-point takedown of his blog post, but
halfway through it I realized I was being an asshole. So instead I want to
discuss where I think he's wrong.</p>

<p>I mentioned on Twitter to Jarvis that it's just as important to work on your
co-workers as all the other things you do. He said two interesting things in
response:</p>

<ul>
<li>"This is what I don't like about big companies"</li>
<li>"I work on computers, not people"</li>
</ul>

<p>First, I've worked at places both big and small. There is nothing inherently
better about either type. Do not kid yourself thinking only great things
happen at small companies. Great things happen when groups of smart people
get together and are given permission to go make it happen.</p>

<p>I've seen it work at large places where managers "ran interference" so their
employees could make stuff happen. I've seen small places stifle creativity
in their employees out of fear of change.</p>

<p>It's not the size of the company that matters, it's how they choose to work
together that matters.</p>

<p>The second point is the one where I think Jarvis has made the biggest mistake
in his approach.</p>

<p>We work FOR people USING computers. The computer is a tool
to achieve a goal. Those goals are achieved by working with others, whether
you wish to believe that or not.</p>

<p>As someone who has worked from home for a long time, I understand and
sympathize with many of the things Jarvis indicates that bug him. Noise
from co-workers, drive-by meetings, feeling pressure to participate in
social activities.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, to accomplish anything of substance requires me
to interact with others in REAL TIME. I have proven that I can both get work
done AND not be such an asshole that others choose to ignore the remote
worker instead of working hard to integrate me into the team.</p>

<p>I find that socializing with my co-workers is a good way to learn about the
people I work with, so that when I need something from them later they are
less likely to say "why the fuck should I help that guy?" I need their help
as much as they need mine.</p>

<p>Of course, I don't think this bit at the end helps much:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I am extremely productive in this setting. For five years I have cranked out more code in this room than many people have written in their entire careers.</p>
    
    <p>I am exceedingly good at my job and I am sick of being told that my lack of cultural involvement makes me a bad employee.</p>
    
    <p><em>mic drop</em></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Disrespecting co-workers isn't always the smartest move. Failing to understand
why others think that being aloof and distant and insisting that results matter
more than how you treat people isn't always the smartest move either.</p>

<p>Tech is not a meritocracy, despite our wishes for it to be. Jarvis, you're not
alone in wanting people to just leave you the hell alone so you can get some
work done. I am that way many times, but I make sure to create those bonds
with my co-workers so that the amount of time that I spend with them is
enjoyable instead of resenting the time there.</p>

<p>Nothing creates bonds of friendship like a shitty job, but being friendly with
your co-workers costs you nothing but a little time, time you're probably
spending doing horrible things like reading the comments on Hacker News.</p>
