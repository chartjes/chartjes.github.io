            <p>Want the chance to work with me?  If you live in the Greater Toronto Area (we don't pay relocation costs or sponsor people) and know PHP, we may have a job for you.  We're looking to fill at least two positions I'm aware of:  nne junior developer and one intermediate developer.  Here's what my boss said he's looking for:


<blockquote>VerticalScope Inc. is seeking a highly skilled professional programmer with extensive expertise in developing PHP and MySQL applications. The position will be focused on the custom development of vBulletin applications, CMS tools, search engine optimization, tool bar creation for our network of sports, automotive and technology sites. If you like working in a creative and fast-paced environment, please send your resume to jmillman@verticalscope.com. Please ensure your qualifications match those outlined below before applying.

Requirements:
To be considered for this role, your background should include:
? 4+ years of development experience in PHP (including hands on experience in your current/last role)
? 4+ years of experience in MySQL (including hands on experience in your current/last role)
? Experience with high-availability, clustering and load balancing, familiarity with Linux, Apache, Perl, CVS, vBulletin development experience an asset
? Experience and comfort in a FreeBSD shell and with FreeBSD development environment
? Shell scripting in Perl, Bash, or other languages an asset

About VerticalScope
VerticalScope is a leading Internet media company providing detailed coverage and analysis of the Technology, Automotive, and Sports vertical markets. Our network of industry web portals, online communities, and print publications reach over five million enthusiasts and decision makers each month.

</blockquote>

That's for the intermediate position.  For the junior position, it's the same sort of qualifications but only 2+ years of experience.  You'll be spending your time working with a small group of IT guys who are great at coming up with solutions to difficult problems.  The ability to deploy applications problem-free is critical, as you will see what it's like to deploy applications for users who don't tolerate any downtime or problems with their sites.  
</p>

<p>
We're a very small IT shop (2 programmers, 1 HTML/CSS person, 2 sys admins) so finding a person who has the skills *and* will fit in with our mix of personalities (having a sense of humour is key around here) is critical.  After all, I want to like the people that I work with.</p>

<p>
If you think that you are a good fit for us, send your resume to me at chartjes@verticalscope.com with the subject "PHP / MySQL Developer position" and I'll make sure it gets to the right people.
