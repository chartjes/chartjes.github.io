<p>Is it possible to both be excited and filled with dread at buying a house and moving? We found
a place in the small town where we live (literally a 5 minute drive) and buying
it is conditional on selling our current place in a very tight window (about 5
weeks).</p>

<p>I'm pretty organized these days so the move will likely go smooth but I am going
to spend all winter in a foul move if it falls through.</p>

<li>the IBL regular season is almost over -- 2 weeks to go and my team sits at 73-73</li>

<p>Nothing really other than my absences from home make me realize what
a creature of routine I have become over the years. Even an overnight
visit feels like it was super long. Weird sensation for sure.</p>

<li>no IBL games this week as we had a real week off -- will be playing some games this upcoming Sunday</li>
<li>amazing turnout for Commander night -- 24 people</li>
<li>put my favourite deck back together (<a href="https://archidekt.com/decks/9190742/grolnok_v3">Grolnok Turbo Self-Mill</a> and remembered how that deck quickly becomes the archenemy of the table as it is fast and consistent</li>

<h2 id="longer-threads">Longer Threads</h2>

<p>This upcoming Monday I am going to a meeting with my mother
at the nursing home where my father lives to go over his
care. Some of you might know that my father is suffering 
from dementia for about a decade now and has been in
this home for 2-1/2 years now.</p>

<p>I try and see him whenever I go back to visit my mom and
for the most part the visits have gone okay. He seems to
almost always remember that he has a son and the last
few visits he always recognizes my mother. Conversations
are hard because he doesn't remember anything and I don't
have enough things on my phone to really distract him. My
mother often brings an iPad with her and shows him videos
or pictures of things.</p>

<p>The whole thing is really, really sad. I have no idea if
I will dodge the same fate as him.</p>

<p>I think the thing that bothers me the most is that while
he looks like and sounds like my Dad, it's not. He never
remembers I have kids or that I am married. I haven't
heard him talk about my older sister at all.</p>

<p>I just wish he was able to experience that his son truly
made it and has a nice comfortable life.</p>

Don't worry, all the individual validators have tests</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="longer-threads">Longer Threads</h2>

<p>I was going to do a longer piece on how I felt I was at
a "crossroads" with my IDE choices. I know it sounds like
dramatic whining.</p>

<p>I have been a Vim/NeoVim user for a long time. The HJKL
muscle memory is burned in and I expect almost everything
I use to be modal. For everything other than PHP, I use
NeoVim.</p>

<p>But lately I am feeling...resentful about how all the tools
I have started to rely on seem to have "becoming a subscription"
as an aspirational goal. My renewal for my PhpStorm subscription
is coming up and I am trying to decide if I can just not renew
it and go back to NeoVim.</p>

<p>The ONLY reason I switched to using PhpStorm was because it
made some other aspects of development work easier:</p>

<ul>
<li>easily get Xdebug working and a slick interface for it</li>
<li>same with doing development work with Dockerized development environments</li>
<li>make it easy to run my tests inside that Dockerized environments</li>
<li>"intellesense" support baked in</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other editors I have looked at -- <a href="https://helix-editor.com">Helix</a>,
<a href="https://zed.dev">Zed</a>, and even the dreaded Emacs. Other than Emacs,
the newer editors fall down when we get to the plugin and
customization phage of creating a development environment.</p>

<p>From a pragmatic side, sticking with NeoVim due to intimate 
familiarity with it's modal nature and basic keybindings
makes the most sense.</p>

<p>Emacs is an interesting choice because it is basically like
NeoVim in that it has a long, rich history and is incredibly
configurable. But learning a whole new series of keybindings?
Seems very daunting.</p>

<p>Helix seems nice. Xdebug support appears to be very rough to
get working. Have to have it for my PHP work, sorry. No idea
if it can be made to support Xdebug running inside a Docker
container. Again, need to check back later.</p>

<p>Zed -- no support for Xdebug. I'll check back later when
they maybe bake in Debug Anywhere Protocol support.</p>

<p>So time to see if I can get NeoVim to give me the extra
tooling that PhpStorm currently offers.</p>

<p>I read an excelled blog post from Steven Yegge where he talked about how
he felt it was a <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">bad time to be a junior developer</a>,
which dovetails nicely into me needing to deliver a talk at the end
of October to the audience at <a href="https://cascadiaphp.com">Cascadia PHP</a>
about how a hater like me uses LLM's.</p>

<p>I don't want to spoil the main points of the talk, but it is fair
to say I already use some LLM's (Apple iPhone already has stuff
in it) and I have occasionally turned it on when trying to refactor
some code.</p>

<p>Can't ignore all the grifters and rent-seekers hanging around
the industry and it does feel like a bubble is gonna pop.</p>

<p>I tried out Emacs this week at work for a little bit each
day and it is just different enough from what my Vim
muscle memory wants that I have put it on hold.</p>

<p>Instead, I am concentrating on building new muscle memory
to use <a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">home row mods</a>
to reduce how often I have to reach for the Shift and Alt keys.
It's jarring to actually feel the pause as I stop to use the
home row "shift".</p>

<p>I came across a blog post from a developer about <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-08-11-why-emacs-switch/">why they switched to Emacs</a>
and it make me wonder if I should try switching from Vim to Emacs. Again.</p>

<p>I tried it once before but couldn't duplicate my developer work flow.
I feel like the combination of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> + <a href="http://xahlee.info/emacs/misc/xah-fly-keys.html">xah-fly-keys</a> is
a great start since it would give me a similar modal editing experience
that I expect in my editor.</p>

<p>Of course, the bigger issue is that I would have to set things up twice
-- once on my work computer that ZiffDavis gave me and once on my own
machine. I also pay for a license for <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>
and it is up for renewal soon.</p>

<p>Good to keep learning things. I've been using Vim so long that navigating via H-J-K-L
is deeply embedded in muscle memory. I have noticed over the years that I don't really
do much "web surfing" on my laptop -- I use my iPhone for that so having Vim bindings
for my browser doesn't make mush sense.</p>

It's not that my ego think you want to know about all aspects

<p>I keep coming back to the phrase "post-testing software development world" and are finally organizing these thoughts.
I should probably do a series of blog posts here about it. It's clear that things have definitely shifted in terms
of commitment to testing and with an audience mostly-receptive to the concepts, a shift in how to teach and
advocate for testing seems reasonable.</p>

            <updated>2024-07-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2024/07/19/debugging-running-python-app/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="spoiled-by-xdebug%3F">Spoiled by Xdebug?</h2>

<p>For all the insults that PHP catches, one that seems to
never come up is how good <a href="https://xdebug.org">Xdebug</a> is
for figuring out what might be going on in an application.</p>

<p>I have been porting over a Python web app that is used to
trigger a batch processing job that validates online purchases.
I have been rewriting parts of it in PHP + Laravel + queue workers
and as part of the testing, I was trying to figure out why I
could not trigger the batch processing properly.</p>

<p>I have been spoiled by being able to use Xdebug to figure out
what is going on with my PHP applications, but had never used
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">Python's debugger</a>.</p>

<p>Since I am a happy <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm">PhpStorm</a> user
I figured I should also use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm">PyCharm</a>
to do my Python dev work. I figured they were similar enough that it
wouldn't be painful to debug.</p>

<p>As an aside, learning how to use a debugger for your preferred programming
language will give you real productivity gains. No more <code>die('here')</code> statements
in your code.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-work-in-python%3F">How does this work in Python?</h2>

<p>So, having no experience with Python debugging I ass-u-me'd that it would
be behaving similar to how Xdebug does things:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure you have a version of Python with debugger support</li>
<li>it sends messages out on a specific port</li>
<li>tell the IDE to listen</li>
<li>set your breakpoint</li>
<li>wait for the nice debugger output to come up</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, dear friends, this is not how it worked at all. I was stumped and
wondering "why doesn't it work like Xdebug?!?". Which is, of course,
silly. It was just my assumptions that were wrong.</p>

<p>I spent some time doing online searches with all sorts of variations
on how to debug Python apps in PyCharm. Lots of interesting and
helpful blog posts...none of which covered what I was trying to do.</p>

<p>I asked on federated social media for some help -- again, some helpful
advice but I got variations of "don't try it that way". Now, that is
well-intentioned but not really an answer.</p>

<p>I had a web app, running locally inside a Python virtual environment. This
shouldn't be hard. I was starting to think that the issue was that I was
not using the same terms as everyone else.</p>

<p>With a running app, I kept wondering "so how do I continually restart the
application to turn on the debugger" as that seemed to me at the time
the only solution for the issue.</p>

<p>Clearly, I was doing it wrong.</p>

<p>While doing some more random searches, I finally stumbled across something
that turned out the be the solution. In a blog post (sorry, I did not
bookmark it) about debugging another Python web application the person
said "...and just attach the debugger to a running process".</p>

<p>Apologies to people who might not get the reference, but if you've ever
seen an image of a person thinking about something and then a light bulb
goes on over head? That is what it was like.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-by-attaching-to-a-running-process">Debugging by attaching to a running process</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that these details are while using PyCharm 2024.1.4 (Professional Edition).
So, in my situation I had this:</p>

<ul>
<li>project is configured in PyCharm to use the Python interpreter in my virtual environment</li>
<li>the application is running</li>
<li>I have set a breakpoint in my Python code</li>
</ul>

<p>Inside PyCharm I went to <code>Run &gt; Attatch to Process</code> and was presented with
some Python processes along with their process ID (I'm on MacOS). I selected the
one for my application and then made my request to the web app to turn
start the batch processing and it worked! I could now
debug things inside and figure out how things are working.</p>

<p>Hope this helps folks who are less-familiar with Python and it's
debugging capabilities get up to speed faster.</p>

"AI" and LLM's lately on my Mastodon account. I thought
I would do a longer piece here on my blog since endless
threads on Mastodon are no substitute for longer-form
writing. Besides, I haven't blogged in two weeks and already
broke my promise to myself of weekly posts here.</p>

<p>Anyway, onwards.</p>

<h2 id="we%27re-being-bamboozled">We're Being Bamboozled</h2>

<p>First off, let's get my main objection out of the way. This
is not Artificial Intelligence in any way, shape, or form.
It is the triumph of marketing and people desperate to grab
dynastic wealth for themselves.</p>

<p>Large Language Models are, in my opinion, very cool technology.
Their ability to take some text written in a more natural language
and generate some output from them is really good. Writing
parsers and interpreters is hard. Making one where the language
you use is not full of weird syntax is even harder.</p>

<p>No, the real issue is that a bunch of people who want to get rich
enough so they never have to interact with us are lying. This is
not artificial intelligence. It is a stochastic parrot, stringing
words together that sound reasonable but very often are full of
shit and not what we asked for.</p>

<p>Since our industry is full of unserious, mediocre people who
think they are competent and serious, the full-press marketing
effort to convince the people who make decisions at companies
across all sorts of industry that "AI is here to make you
easy profits!!!!" is on.</p>

<p>I am not the first person to point out that while the technology
has not gotten to the point where so many people can be replaced
by an LLM, way too many CEO's and other senior leadership have
been convinced that it has reached that point.</p>

<p>The outcome of this is going to be disastrous for any leaders
who have not already figured out how to ensure their compensation
is not tied to the actual performance of their companies.</p>

<p>I was there when Napster became a thing. It was awesome to be able
to find all sorts of music you liked and download it to your computer.
I also remember how the music industry freaked out and intended
to sue people for millions of dollars for downloading one song.</p>

<p>As with everything, this freakout was because they had not figured out
a way of making money off the renting of music to people. In our streaming
world, our fate has been sealed -- it is becoming harder and harder to
own "physical" copies of popular items, especially film and music.</p>

<p>But for this new business model of providing natural language prompts that
take our questions and respond with useful answers to work and make monopoly
profits for all involved, they have to read in as much information as possibly
to train their systems. This also means they are brazenly reading in all
sorts of material they do not have permissions to do so.</p>

<p>Then, with a straight face, they tell us we must let them do it or else.</p>

<p>Look, for many years I posted content for free all over the internet. My old
blog (of which the archives are part of this one) and thousands and thousands
of posts to Twitter and Facebook. I understood that as long as I was deliberately
making these posts publicly, I was okay with other people slicing and dicing up
the content.</p>

<p>This is the main premise of the internet I joined and embraced in the early 2000's.</p>

<p>However, I have produced content for which I have been paid. Multiple books, conference
talks, and videos for sale. I am 99.999% sure that books and videos I have created
were slurped up by one of these companies. I did not give them permission. But
given how favourable the US legal system is towards corporations (plus the fact
that I live in Canada) the chances of me getting any kind of compensation for them
making unauthorized copies of what I created is pretty much zero.</p>

<p>They are, from my perspective, thieves wearing business suits or hoodies, depending
on your mental image of what you think an "AI" business owner looks like.</p>

<p>Fuck you, pay me.</p>

<h2 id="scraping-used-to-be-okay">Scraping Used To Be Okay</h2>

<p>To head off some more popular arguments, yes, search engines could not exist without
people giving permission for their content to be scanned, summarized, and categorized.
Again, I am okay with this since by posting my things publicly I gave permission
for this.</p>

<p>It is pretty much impossible to become a programmer with a broad range of skills if
you do not have search engines that accurately answer your prompts. We have questions.
We do not necessarily work or are in close contact with people who have answers. So we
go online and search for those answers.</p>

<p>For a long time, search engines were useful. Then Google, flush with cash and convinced
that having created one incredibly technology, could do anything it wanted. So it used
their incredibly search engine and plastered it with ads to make money. But failure
after failure caused them to lean more and more onto what was now an advertising platform
with a side effect of providing some answers to questions.</p>

<p>Someone much smarter than me has pointed out that LLM's help create the illusion that
so many grifters and non-technical people wanted to believe: that ideas are what mattered
instead of the ability to execute on those ideas.</p>

<p>There is a reason the stereotype of the "bro with an idea who justs needs a technical
person to implement it" persists.</p>

<p>Now, LLM folks believe if we will just shut the hell up and let them steal everything
that isn't nailed down (and take a lot of stuff that is nailed down but nobody is actively
watching) they will no longer need the implementers. Their grand ideas will finally
see the light of day. More importantly, they won't have to share the money with anybody else.</p>

<p>I will not willingly help these people. I am not some cog in their wheel of ambition.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-llm%27s-are-good-for%3F">Is There Anything LLM's Are Good For?</h2>

<p>Of course there are.</p>

<p>One of my co-workers has started using a service called Otter to take transcripts of our meetings at work
so they have reference material. There is nothing revolutionary about taking notes for meetings to
use later. However, it is not a replacement for not attending the meeting. Too many folks
are presenting it as such. Come to the damn meeting and stop acting like you are too
special to be here and discuss the issues with us.</p>

<p>LLM's are providing a lot of value to people as tools to help them solve coding issues.
I am not using them out of choice but I suspect there may come a time when search engines become
enshittified enough that I will have to resort to an LLM to provide me with the skeleton
of solutions to my problems. These sort of tools are nothing more than fancy autocomplete.
There will not be a time any time soon where I can feed it a list of requirements for
a web application and it will create one that works flawlessly and does not need
maintenance.</p>

<p>As a tool for applying a vast number of changes to a code base in a short period of time,
they will be awesome. As a tool to replace someone who understands how to turn natural
language requirements into code? No chance. But too many greedy business owners have
bought the hype and believe they are. I look forward to seeing those businesses suffer
the consequences of poor management.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>

<p>So, what can we really do?</p>

<p>Well, I think people who work in this industry
like I do can stop hyping it as a replacement for problem solving
and critical thought. These systems do not learn from their mistakes.
They will just keep making them over and over again.</p>

<p>I also feel it is critical to not turn a blind eye to
the fact that these companies are asking us to allow them,
for free, to slurp up everything they find online in an attempt
to sell it back to us.</p>

<p>Given how they fought to have anyone who touched anything that
belonged to them, do not let them off the hook now that stealing
stuff is their best interests.  A lot of these companies have already
been stealing wages from you. Don't let them take anything else.</p>

<p>Finally, understand that being a luddite doesn't mean that you
hate technology -- you hate the exploitation of people via the
use of technology.</p>

<p>Band together. Don't let companies treat you like garbage. Don't
believe the AI hype. This is another bubble and the companies that
are choosing to make the bubble their identity will fail.</p>
