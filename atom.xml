            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="neovim-and-xdebug">NeoVim and Xdebug</h1>

<p>As I continue to work on the configuration for the <a href="https://neovim.io">One True Editor</a>
I had everything working just about the way that duplicated how I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>
except for one thing -- using <a href="https://xdebug.org">Xdebug</a>.</p>

<p>As I write this blog post I have an article submitted for <a href="https://www.phparch.com">php[architect]</a>
on how I use NeoVim to do PHP development work and in that article
I talked about the next few things I was going to work on adding
support for ($100 a year to do enemy research on Copilot AI?!?)
and getting the tool that I regret not embracing earlier but
now find it indispensable.</p>

<p>This is not the blog post if you are looking to figure out
how to get Xdebug running with whatever version of PHP you
are trying to use. The excellent documentation on the Xdebug
web site will absolutely point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>In my case, I went the route of manually compiling the 3.2.x
series (I honestly cannot remember why) but most package
managers for your operating system of choice can help you
with that.</p>

<h2 id="xdebug-and-dap">Xdebug and DAP</h2>

<p>DAP (which is short for the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/">Debug Anywhere Protocol</a>.
Look, you can quibble about who is behind DAP but the overarching
goal of providing a standardized way for both debugging tools
and programming languages to talk to each other makes a lot
of sense. The <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a>
is a similar effort that has found a lot of traction outside
of Microsoft.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>You to have the following before we get started:</p>

<ul>
<li>a version of PHP with Xdebug support</li>
<li>NeoVim 0.5+ or better</li>
<li>the ability to edit your NeoVim configuration files</li>
<li>the ability to install NeoVim plugins</li>
<li>Node installed (need it to install some tooling)</li>
<li>Git CLI tools installed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="debug-adapter-for-php">Debug Adapter for PHP</h2>

<p>To start, I followed the excellent instructions found <a href="https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/wiki/Debug-Adapter-installation#PHP">here</a>
but to replicate them here:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">git clone https://github.com/xdebug/vscode-php-debug.git
cd vscode-php-debug
npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build
</code></pre>

<p>Leveraging an existing tool to make it work is always galaxy-brain-level
thinking.</p>

<p>Next, I decided on which plugins I wanted to use to interact
with Xdebug while inside NeoVim. I chose:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap">mfussenegger/nvim-dap</a> for high-level support</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui">rcarriga/nvim-dap-ui</a> as my UI for looking at the debug details</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/theHamsta/nvim-dap-virtual-text">theHamsta/nvim-dap-virtual-text</a> find variable definitions</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-dap.nvim">nvim-telescope/telescope-dap.nvim</a> to provide compatibility with Telescope</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, I encourage people to start with a base that WORKS and
then start experimenting to get it the way you want it.</p>

<h2 id="dap-plugin-configuration">DAP Plugin Configuration</h2>

<p>Again, this is for my own setup. It might be different for your
own.</p>

<p>I needed to make sure that I turn on Telescope support in my
<code>init.vim</code> file. I need it for other plugins but make sure
you enable it if you are using <code>telescope-dap.nvim</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">lua require('telescope').setup
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the above is how to load <a href="https://www.lua.org">Lua</a> files
inside a <a href="https://devhints.io/vimscript">Vimscript</a> file. I am starting
to work on the outline of using Lua for all my NeoVim configuration
settings.</p>

<p>Next, I have a configuration file just for DAP that I also load in
my <code>init.vim</code> file:</p>

<pre><code class="lua">local dap = require('dap')
require('telescope').load_extension('dap')

dap.adapters.php = {
    type = "executable",
    command = "node",
    args = { os.getenv("HOME") .. "/vscode-php-debug/out/phpDebug.js" }
}

dap.configurations.php = {
    {
        type = "php",
        request = "launch",
        name = "Listen for Xdebug",
        port = 9003
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In here I tell NeoVim:</p>

<ul>
<li>load the DAP extension for Telescope (it overrides the default UI)</li>
<li>I want to use the VS Code DAP adapter</li>
<li>what port to listen for Xdebug info on (Xdebug 3.2.x goes with 9003 as the standard port)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the Xdebug web site section <a href="https://github.com/xdebug/vscode-php-debug#supported-launchjson-settings">about VS Code</a>
it points out that you can also add in a <code>pathMappings</code>
value in <code>dap.configurations.php</code> to "map the files on the server to
the right files on your local machine." and gives an example.</p>

<p>I don't use <code>pathMappings</code> and my setup works just fine.</p>

<p>Of course, I could not really use Xdebug from inside the editor without
some keyboard mappings:</p>

<pre><code class="lua">vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;F5&gt;', function() require('dap').continue() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;F10&gt;', function() require('dap').step_over() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;F11&gt;', function() require('dap').step_into() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;F12&gt;', function() require('dap').step_out() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;Leader&gt;b', function() require('dap').toggle_breakpoint() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;Leader&gt;B', function() require('dap').set_breakpoint() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;Leader&gt;lp', function() require('dap').set_breakpoint(nil, nil, vim.fn.input('Log point message: ')) end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;Leader&gt;dr', function() require('dap').repl.open() end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;Leader&gt;dl', function() require('dap').run_last() end)
vim.keymap.set({'n', 'v'}, '&lt;Leader&gt;dh', function()
  require('dap.ui.widgets').hover()
end)
vim.keymap.set({'n', 'v'}, '&lt;Leader&gt;dp', function()
  require('dap.ui.widgets').preview()
end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;Leader&gt;df', function()
  local widgets = require('dap.ui.widgets')
  widgets.centered_float(widgets.frames)
end)
vim.keymap.set('n', '&lt;Leader&gt;ds', function()
  local widgets = require('dap.ui.widgets')
  widgets.centered_float(widgets.scopes)
end)
</code></pre>

<p>My usual workflow for debugging is:</p>

<ul>
<li>code I am debugging open in the editor</li>
<li>if I didn't already start debugging, hit <code>F5</code> to turn on the debugging session</li>
<li>set breakpoints where I want them with <code>\b</code></li>
<li>run the code, step through the breakpoints, and see what's going on</li>
</ul>

<p>Not different in any significant way than how I would do things in PhpStorm.</p>

<p>So there you have it! If you are a NeoVim user and want to
start utilizing Xdebug to help you, well, debug your code
faster my documentation above should get you pointed in
the correct direction.</p>

            <link href="https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2023/03/09/thinking-about-it-too-much/"/>
            <updated>2023-03-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2023/03/09/thinking-about-it-too-much/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="thinking-about-testing-too-much">Thinking About Testing Too Much</h1>

<p>Back in February and had a <a href="https://www.freethegeek.fm/51">very long and fun chat</a> with
my friend Matt Setter about the one topic I think about way too much -- testing. Rather
than steal what Matt wrote, just go read the linked above post to get a sense of what
we discussed. If you have followed my rantings online for any period of time, none of
what I discussed there should be new to you.</p>

<p>I mean, you can't really blame me -- my career niche has been "testing PHP code" since at
least 2006. That is a really, really long time to be focussed on an issue. Now, I might
not be the best programmer (a lot of times I feel like I have been doing programming for
1 year, 25 times) but I do know a ton about what does and does not lead to good outcomes
for long-running projects.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-wave-of-testing">The Next Wave Of Testing</h2>

<p>As I write this, I am at a crossroads as to what to talk about next. I'm kind of over speaking
at conferences except in places I have not been (if you are an organizer of an event in Africa,
South America, or Japan -- please get in touch) and I am not sure I want to put the effort
in to write yet another book or do training courses. If I am being honest, I am getting older
and like hanging out at home more and having unstructured time. I have two frustrating hobbies
that can keep my mind sharp. Arguing with people about testing their code feels like a losing
proposition and a huge waste of my time.</p>

<p>So, what I have found interesting is the increasingly-growing idea that there are some code-related
things that you can do that can reduce the amount of tests you need to write for your code
or sometimes even eliminate them. This is, of course, at best misguided and at worst, wrong.</p>

<h2 id="types-as-tests">Types As Tests</h2>

<p>When they got introduced into the language, I viewed typing (I define it as declaring at creation
what 'type' of thing an object or variable is supposed to be) as something that would get rid
of some types of tests I found myself writing and allow the PHP interpreter to enforce rules
about what sort of things my code was returning to other code that called it. No more tests
verifying that a method returned an array!</p>

<p>They are NOT a substitute for tests. They are a helpful tool that provides intent for your code
and greatly reduces the likelihood of SOME types of errors happening when (for example) your
code is expecting a list of things and instead gets a string.</p>

<h2 id="static-analysis-as-tests">Static Analysis As Tests</h2>

<p>Static analysis tools are something I have been using professionally for a few years. They are
an additional layer ON TOP OF types that goes even further down the road of making sure the intent
of your code is clear. Sure, it's annoying to have a tool say "well, actually, you said over HERE
that you are expecting an array but you ACTUALLY are passing a list. What one is it?" but it's
better than you trying to figure out why some code you wrote yesterday suddenly stopped working
today when you (and this is often not reality) "didn't change anything".</p>

<p>Again, these are NOT a substitute for tests. They are a COMPLEMENTARY tool for testing. Just because
PHPStan is not reporting any errors doesn't mean your code is behaving as expected!</p>

<h2 id="grumpy%27s-theory-on-tests">Grumpy's Theory On Tests</h2>

<p>I am incredibly confident in saying that you should 100% have automated tests for your application
that cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>business logic</li>
<li>how your users will interact with your app</li>
</ul>

<p>What testing tools you use to make this happens is up to you. If you have done a decent job of
creating a decoupled code base where you are injecting dependencies to your objects (let's be
real, 90% of PHP code out there still running and accessible online is object oriented) then
you should be able to write unit tests where you create the dependencies the code you are testing
needs.</p>

<p>They can be the real thing (which I prefer) or doubles (don't be scared, you probably waste more
time on social media than it would take to keep the doubles in sync as you work on the code base)
but you MUST have the ability to modify these dependencies at run time.</p>

<p>If you also write your code in a more defensive style -- think filtering input, escaping output,
validating things, using immutability -- your tests become easier
to create and the testing scenarios you create become easier and easier to define and implement.</p>

<p>You need tests. Your code should be easy to test. I'm not mad at you if your code isn't in a place
where it easy to test. There are ways  to make them testable. No, I am
not talking about end-to-end tests with browser automation. Those are brittle and I have seen too
many of those types of test suites with weird custom helpers and step definitions that do not
reflect how the application works AT ALL. Don't do that. Browser automation is a last, desperate
test in my opinion.</p>

<p>Write assertion-based tests using real dependencies as much as possible. I'm happy to help you
get there. It will cost some time and some money but it will make the cost of the NEXT change so
much easier.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed the results of thinking too much about this stuff. There is SO much more I want
to learn in order to make your testing tasks easier.</p>

            <id>https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2023/02/10/adding-search-to-a-static-blog/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="why-does-search-matter%3F">Why does search matter?</h2>

<p>I recently decided to take all the old posts from my old blog AtTheKeyboard
and add them to this site. Since I used the same <a href="https://getsculpin.io">blogging system</a> it
was as simple as copying the markdown source into the correct place
and generating static HTML for it.</p>

<p>I used to have a custom Google site search configured but in this new
age of me giving a shit about the <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> I wanted
something a little more open and a little more free. I needed something else.</p>

<p>Like all things, this solution might not work one day but I will worry
about that when the time comes.</p>

<p>Since I have blog posts dating all the way back to 2005 I felt it was
essential to allow folks to search for stuff when they come here.</p>

<h2 id="outsourcing-research">Outsourcing Research</h2>

<p>As someone who has been on social media for along time, the best way to find
an answer is to just ask your devoted audience a question. Eventually someone
will answer you. I had tried to use <a href="https://lunrjs.com">Lunr</a> but there was
a lack of knowledge at my end on how to get the index I generated into the
correct place onto the GitHub-pages-powered version of this web site. I had
decided to just use a really basic "redirect-the-request-to-Google" input text
form and rely on my site's new content getting indexed sometime soon.</p>

<p>Probably not great but I am the type of person who is lazy-with-intense-bursts-of-action.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, <a href="https://phpc.social/@dgoosens">Dmitri Goosens</a> found a solution
and let me know. I under 30 minutes I had it all working. Which is stunning to me.</p>

<h2 id="pagefind">Pagefind</h2>

<p><a href="https://pagefind.app">Pagefind</a> is a CLI-based solution that appears to do everything
I wanted:</p>

<ul>
<li>it can be run via the CLI</li>
<li>it will index all your blog posts</li>
<li>they provide you with snippets of code to embed search boxes and results</li>
<li>it's customizable (came in handy due to some GitHub Pages limitations)</li>
</ul>

<p>Their documentation is great and I now have working static search for my blog. For those</p>

<h2 id="how-i-do-it">How I Do It</h2>

<p>After adding the suggested code snippets to the pages for my blog, I do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>build the site pages</li>
<li>run Pagefind to generate the index, specifying where my blog posts are and what directory to put Pagefind-specific stuff in</li>
<li>copy all the stuff over to the repo for my blog</li>
<li>add the changes, commit, and push!</li>
</ul>

<p>So, if you have a static blog and were wondering how to make it work, I highly
recommend giving Pagefind a try.</p>

            <link href="https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2023/01/19/monkeypatching-in-php/"/>
            <updated>2023-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2023/01/19/monkeypatching-in-php/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-is-monkey-patching%3F">What is monkey patching?</h2>

<p>I first learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patching</a> via the Ruby community. Due to how
the language worked, Rubyists tended to override dependencies in their
tests at run-time, rather than using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double">test doubles</a>.
Personally I find the ability to redefine <em>any</em> part of the language to be interesting. It 
certainly does make testing easier.</p>

<p>Now, PHP doesn't support the sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> that lends
itself to making monkey patching easy. Sure, you used to be able to use the Runkit extension but
these days, it's not being maintained. So, when we run into a situation where you need to redefine
some functionality at run time, your options are limited.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-use-it%3F">When to use it?</h2>

<p>Like I said before, it can be an alternative to using test doubles. But there are also some
interesting scenarios where, due to both PHP's behaviour and the architecture of an application,
we can make a change at run time.</p>

<p>At my <a href="https://smartours.com">current gig</a> I was adding some functionality
to verify some objects representing the prices of objects are configured
correctly. One of my tests was to ensure that a specific exception was
being triggered, and that meant creating a new exception object that
extended a "loggable" one.</p>

<p>This is code that is being implemented as a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin</a>
for WordPress and the logging object I needed to use had some very
WordPress-specific functionality in it. But I didn't want to have to use all
the WordPress-specific stack just for this test. On top of this, the logging
object wasn't in a namespace that my <a href="https://phpunit.de">PHPUnit</a> tests could
even see.</p>

<p>So what were my options? My first was to modify the <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>
autoloading configuration and add the namespace to it. I then had a way to
"force" logging into "test mode" but I wasn't entirely happy with it. The
tests passed, the exception was being triggered, but I had worries in the back
of my mind about whether or not we'd have to do something to the WordPress
side of the application in order to support this.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://phpc.social/@omerida">co-worker</a> showed me how they were already overriding some things at run-time,
so it was better to go with what was already working. Introducing uncertainty
into our application was not the end goal. Here was their solution:</p>

<p>There was an existing <code>test/bootstrap.php</code> file so it was suggested to add a run-time
check to see if the application was attempting to instantiate our logging
object via an autoloader and then instead tell it to use a different one.</p>

<p>First, a replacement logger was created...</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace Smartours\Log;

use Monolog\Handler\NullHandler;
use Monolog\Logger;

class Log
{
    public static function logger(): Logger
    {
        $logger = new Logger('generic');
        $logger-&gt;pushHandler(new NullHandler());

        return $logger;
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>...and then we just included it in our bootstrap file.</p>

<pre><code>require __DIR__ . '/bootstrap/SmartoursLog.php';
</code></pre>

<p>Now, my code that is calling an exception...that needs that
base <code>Log</code> object...will use my <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">fake</a>
instead.</p>

<p>The test passes and all is in order again.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-alternatives%3F">What are some alternatives?</h2>

<p>In a more testable world, what logging object the code is
expecting to use could be done via a configuration file. We'd
still be creating a fake logger, but the mechanism to load it
would be different. Most "modern" PHP web application frameworks
support the use of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern">service locaters</a>
and they can be leveraged to make sure your tests have access
to the dependencies they need.</p>

<p>In the future, if we ever needed to add tests for things like making
sure the message the exception we throw shows up in the correct log
file, this solution will have to adapt to those needs.</p>

<p>As always, everyone's testing situation is different and finding
one that fits your need is more important than being perfect..</p>

            <title type="html"><![CDATA[How a grumpy programmer writes Python IRC bots]]></title>
            <link href="https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2022/12/31/python-irc-bot/"/>
            <updated>2022-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2022/12/31/python-irc-bot/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="why-python-and-why-irc%3F">Why Python and why IRC?</h2>

<p>My longest-running hobby is being a member of <a href="https://www.ibl.org">tabletop simulation baseball league</a>
that uses dice and cards and charts to determine outcomes. There are a lot
of charts so a signifcant amount of time is spent looking up results that
players haven't memorized.</p>

<p>Our league uses IRC as the way to play the games -- the players connect to
the server we host and then play games out using a bot that rolls dice
and communicating with each other via text. Very old school.</p>

<p>Making things a little more player-friendly will help the league get
team owners up to speed quicker, so naturally I turned to automation
and programming as a way to do it.</p>

<p>I chose Python because it had been a while since I had done <em>anything</em> with
it, so why not sharpen the dull edge of my experience there a little. Thankfully
there are lots of examples on how to work with IRC using just the default
libraries that come with Python. In this case, the server the bot would be
running on runs Python 3.8. I started off with <a href="https://pythonspot.com/building-an-irc-bot/">this blog post</a>
and went from there.</p>

<h2 id="initial-implementation">Initial implementation</h2>

<p>From a high level, we are doing the following</p>

<p>1) connect to the IRC server
2) loop endlessly while grabbing any responses from the server
3) examine those responses for my chosen chartbot trigger
4) if triggered, then look for dice rolls
5) display results in-channel</p>

<p>Now, I am sure there are better implementations for what I am trying
to do here involving more commonly-accepted design patterns. In fact,
the code analysis tools I am using are already complaining that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</a>
is too high.</p>

<p>So, here is an example of what I have been doing</p>

<pre><code class="python">while True:
    text = irc.get_response()

    if "PRIVMSG" in text and ".c ifr" in text:
        details = text.split(' ')
        msgChannel = details[-4].strip()
        batterHand[msgChannel] = details[-1].strip()
        lookForIfrRoll[msgChannel] = "yes"
</code></pre>

<p>An example command that this would look for would be '.c ifr rsp'.
This maps to:</p>

<ul>
<li>.c is "activate chartbot"</li>
<li>ifr is "Infield Range"</li>
<li>rsp is "right-spray hitter", with other options available</li>
</ul>

<p>Early on I realized that I needed to have some kind of "state"
in here because it was a two-step process. Once it knew which
chart it was supposed to refer to, it then needed to wait to
get a die roll. Again, this feels like a brute-force method
but I could not think of any other way. Maybe, again, there
is a better pattern for keeping track of this.</p>

<p>So, having figured out we want to refer to the "infield range chart"
(commonly known as IFR in game terms), we tell the bot "the next roll
in this channel should be checked to see if it works with the IFR chart."</p>

<p>Here is a sample of the code that watches for an IFR roll:</p>

<pre><code class="python">    if "rolled" in text:
        details = text.split(' ')
        msgChannel = details[-4].strip()
        roll = details[-1].strip()

        if (msgChannel in lookForIfrRoll and
                batterHand[msgChannel] in validBatterHand and
                len(roll) == 2):
            irc.send(
                 msgChannel, ifrChart.lookup(batterHand[msgChannel], roll)
            )
            del lookForIfrRoll[msgChannel]
            del batterHand[msgChannel]

</code></pre>

<p>All rolls for the IFR chart will be from 00-99, so we make sure the rollbot
returned something 2 characters in length. We also make sure that the
batter hand type matches our expectations. If that is all good, then
we call an object that contains our chart information, do a lookup, and
then send the results of that lookup into the channel.</p>

<p>Here is a sample of what the IFR chart object looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="python">class IFRChart:
    chart = {}

    def __init__(self):
        self.chart = {
            'lp': {
                "00": "Up the middle P",
                "01": "High chopper P",
                "02": "Line drive P",
                "03": "Down the line 1B",
                "04": "Down the line 1B",
                "05": "Down the line 1B",
                # more results snipped
            }
        }

    def lookup(self, bats, roll):
        return self.chart[bats][roll]

</code></pre>

<p>I will say that creating this chart objects helped me get my muscle
memory for Emacs in a better place. So much cut-and-pasting-and-replacing
of things!</p>

<p>So there you have it, a small example of how I have started writing an
IRC bot that:</p>

<ul>
<li>reads responses for a trigger</li>
<li>figures out what chart to read</li>
<li>waits for a die roll that matches expectations</li>
<li>spits out the lookup result in channel</li>
</ul>

<p>As always, I am happy to get some advice on better ways to refactor
and implement solutions for this code.</p>

            <updated>2022-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2022/12/13/current-neovim-setup/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="grumpiness-and-neovim">Grumpiness and NeoVim</h2>

<p>I have been a <a href="https://vim.org">Vim</a> user since the early 2000's.
Someone who worked in the same building as me and was also a fellow
Linux user (this was before I had bought my first Macbook) got
to talking with me as I struggled to figure out <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>
suggested I sit with him for a little bit as he showed me how to
use Vim. Still not sure to this day why it clicked with me but I
have been using it ever since.</p>

<p>In the past few years I have changed which version of Vim I am
using and switched to <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a>.</p>

<p>Now, to be transparent, these days I use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>
as my main PHP programming tool and use NeoVim for pretty much everything
else. I do pay for PhpStorm because I think it's important to encourage the creation
of tools for the programming languages I use. If I was still doing a lot of
Python work, I'd be paying for <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>.
I had really good experiences with it while at Mozilla.</p>

<p>Anyway, I still like to keep up with what is going on in the NeoVim "community"
and I am happy to see a vibrant group of people creating plugins and
sharing their knowledge. I wanted to give things with NeoVim and PHP another
spin so it was time to go look at my current setup.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-all-this%3F">Why do all this?</h2>

<p>My goal is to have a Vim experience that matches the way I currently work.
I've been using Vim for so long that there is lots of muscle memory and
I usually enable "Vim mode" in any tools I use. Editing things a "modal way"
has become my default and any tools that don't support doing things that
way slow me down immensely.</p>

<p>So, what do I want out of my NeoVim setup.</p>

<ul>
<li>works well with the languages I will use</li>
<li>allows me to quickly find files</li>
<li>allows me to quickly find source definitions</li>
<li>allows me to quickly find places where code is used</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, of course, PhpStorm does all this but also carries a lot of extra
functionality around with it. Which is fine! But in an era where the tools
we use on desktop operating systems get bigger and bigger and consume more
and more resources, I find something appealing in using tools that take up
as few resources as possible.</p>

<p>I did an older post on my old blog from about a year ago so I will
follow the same structure but I noticed some changes. I'll be going
through my current NeoVim config and filling things in as we go</p>

<pre><code>set nocompatible
syntax on 
set encoding=utf8
filetype off

" Load our plugins
lua require('plugins')
</code></pre>

<p>I am using as much <a href="https://www.lua.org">Lua</a> as I can within NeoVim.
The first few steps here are pretty much standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>you always turn "no compatible" off otherwise lots of things break</li>
<li>I want syntax highlighting by default</li>
<li>I want things to be UTF8</li>
<li>I am going to define my own behaviour for how I want NeoVim to
handle filetypes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="plugins">Plugins</h2>

<p>My list of plugins:</p>

<pre><code class="lua">  return require('packer').startup(function()
    use 'wbthomason/packer.nvim'
    use 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'

    -- General plugins

end)
</code></pre>

<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim">Packer</a> to
handle installing all my packages. I have commented in places where I
felt that things were not clear, but I guess some further explanations
couldn't hurt.</p>

<ul>
<li>I use the <a href="https://draculatheme.com/vim">Dracula</a> theme</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align">vim-easy-align</a>
to make it easier to line up blocks of code</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter">vim-gitgutter</a> shows me
which lines have changed from Git's perspective</li>
<li>I like to respect the
<a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim">EditorConfig</a>
settings for a project if they exist</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim">Telescope</a> 
forms the basis for a lot of fuzzy find functionality</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp">nvim-cmp</a> as my
completion engine (and it plays nicely with Intelephense)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="more-neovim-settings">More NeoVim Settings</h2>

</code></pre>

<p>A lot of what is up there is fairly straightforward when it comes to
Vim/NeoVim, so I am not going to go over a lot of them.</p>

<h2 id="lsp-configuration">LSP Configuration</h2>

<p>This is the critical piece for me -- supporting different languages
makes NeoVim so versatile.</p>

<p>In my config I have these two lines:</p>

<pre><code>lua require('lsp-config')
lua require('nvm-cmp')
</code></pre>

<p>and these handle my languages and making sure autocompletion behaves
as I expect.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>A lot of what is in here I simple stole from other people's
configurations but I think most of it should be straightforward to
figure out.</p>

<p>Some highlights from my perspective:</p>

<ul>
<li>you pick which language servers to care about</li>
<li>you map functionality to existing Vim bindings so, again, it behaves
as expected</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is what I have for getting the autocompletion engine working:</p>

<pre><code class="lua">local capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()

local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')

-- Enable some language servers with the additional completion capabilities offered by nvim-cmp
local servers = { 'intelephense', 'tsserver' }
for _, lsp in ipairs(servers) do
  lspconfig[lsp].setup {
    -- on_attach = my_custom_on_attach,
    capabilities = capabilities,
  }
end

-- luasnip setup
local luasnip = require 'luasnip'

-- nvim-cmp setup
local cmp = require 'cmp'
cmp.setup {
  snippet = {
    expand = function(args)
      require('luasnip').lsp_expand(args.body)
    end,
  },
  mapping = {
    ['&lt;C-p&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.select_prev_item(),
    ['&lt;C-n&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.select_next_item(),
    ['&lt;C-d&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.scroll_docs(-4),
    ['&lt;C-f&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.scroll_docs(4),
    ['&lt;C-Space&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.complete(),
    ['&lt;C-e&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.close(),
    ['&lt;CR&gt;'] = cmp.mapping.confirm {
      behavior = cmp.ConfirmBehavior.Replace,
      select = true,
    },
    ['&lt;Tab&gt;'] = function(fallback)
      if cmp.visible() then
        cmp.select_next_item()
      elseif luasnip.expand_or_jumpable() then
        luasnip.expand_or_jump()
      else
        fallback()
      end
    end,
    ['&lt;S-Tab&gt;'] = function(fallback)
      if cmp.visible() then
        cmp.select_prev_item()
      elseif luasnip.jumpable(-1) then
        luasnip.jump(-1)
      else
        fallback()
      end
    end,
  },
  sources = {
    { name = 'nvim_lsp' },
    { name = 'luasnip' },
  },
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, more mapping of existing keys to get the plugin to behave as
expected. This sort of thing lies at the very heart of how Vim/NeoVim
plugins do so much work -- they literally alter how the application
behaves by overriding things. Perhaps this is actually a form of
monkey patching? TIME IS A CIRCLE.</p>

<h2 id="key-mappings">Key Mappings</h2>

<pre><code class="vim">" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</code></pre>

<p>No Vim setup is complete without mapping and re-mapping keys in
Vim. The list above mostly focuses on making Telescope friendlier to
use.</p>

<p>So there you have it -- this is my current NeoVim setup. It is more
than sufficient for me to do daily PHP development work. What are some
other things I am looking to integrate into my setup?</p>

<ul>
<li>Make it easier to use <a href="https://xdebug.org">XDebug</a></li>
<li>More refactoring tools (I understand Intelephense can help but I
have also experimented with
<a href="https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor">Phpactor</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As always, I continue to tweak my configuration as I evaluate new
tools or discover new ways of completing old tasks. I hope you find my
setup useful.</p>

following decisions had been made:</p>

<ul>
<li>not extending off of a base class</li>
<li>all dependencies are injected at run time</li>
<li>single-method for the class</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="identifying-dependencies">Identifying Dependencies</h2>

<p>So what are the dependencies I will need?</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a href="https://twig.symfony.com">Twig</a> object</li>
<li>a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">repository</a> object for retrieving data</li>
<li>a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html">view model</a> for presenting the data</li>
<li>an object that contains the HTTP <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/">request</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the old architecture, I was creating those dependencies deep inside the "business logic"
and therefore it was very hard to write anything other than some kind of "check
the HTML output" type of test. Ironically that is what the new test does as well but
this sort of decoupled architecture leads to a much more straightforward test.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-output">Identifying Output</h2>

<p>In these tests, I wanted to make sure that if I had at least one rotation
stored in the database for a particular week, when the page renders I should
see that rotation in the output somewhere.</p>

<h2 id="test-skeleton">Test Skeleton</h2>

<p>As always, I break out the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert">Arrange-Act-Assert</a> pattern
to create the skeleton of the test:</p>

<pre><code class="php">    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange

        // Act

        // Assert
        self::fail();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, you always want to start with a failing test.</p>

<h2 id="arranging-our-dependencies">Arranging our dependencies</h2>

<p>These days I try and use the fewest number of <a href="https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/test-doubles.html">test doubles</a>
in my test scenarios. Given the dependencies I needed,
I was going to need three "fake" dependencies, configured
to provide only the implementation details required to make
the scenario work.</p>

<p>I don't want to get into a longer discussion on the use of
test doubles except to say that the decoupling strategy
I am using will minimize the chances that any doubles drift
from how the code is actually implemented.</p>

<p>Trust me, I do this for a living!</p>

<pre><code class="php">    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange
        $loader = new FilesystemLoader(__DIR__ . '/../../templates/');
        $twig = new Environment($loader);

        $gamesRepo = $this-&gt;createMock(GameRepository::class);
        $gamesRepo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getMaxWeek')
            -&gt;willReturn(1);

        $testRotation = new ArrayCollection();
        $testRotation-&gt;add([
            'franchise_id' =&gt; 1,
            'ibl' =&gt; 'MAD',
            'rotation' =&gt; 'One, Two, Three'
        ]);

        $viewModel = $this-&gt;createMock(RotationsUsingDoctrine::class);
        $viewModel-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getAllByWeek')
            -&gt;willReturn($testRotation);

        $request = $this-&gt;createMock(Request::class);
        $request-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getQueryParams')
            -&gt;willReturn(['week' =&gt; 1]);

        // Act

        // Assert
        self::fail();
    }
</code></pre>

<h2 id="acting-on-the-code-under-test">Acting on the code-under-test</h2>

<p>This has always struck me as a weird way to describe "executing the
code we are testing" but I guess "Arrange-Execute-Assert" doesn't
flow in English quite the same way.</p>

<p>Now that I have all my dependencies created and configured the way
I need, time to run the code and grab some results I can test.</p>

<pre><code class="php">    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange

        // Act
        $query = new RotationManagementQuery($twig, $gamesRepo, $viewModel);
        $results = $query-&gt;__invoke($request);

        // Assert
        self::fail();
    }
</code></pre>

<h2 id="asserting-results-of-code-execution">Asserting results of code execution</h2>

<p>Just like I did before, I am checking the HTML output from executing
this Query to make sure I am seeing values that I expect</p>

<pre><code class="php">    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange

        // Act

        // Assert
        self::assertStringContainsString('One, Two, Three', $results-&gt;getBody());
    }
</code></pre>

<p>When building my assertions, I tend to go with "what are the
fewest number of things I need to do in order to prove the
code is working as expected."</p>

<p>In this case, I felt checking that I see an expected "pitching rotation"
in the output is good enough.</p>

<p>Here is what the whole test looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace Webreg\Test\Query;

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Slim\Psr7\Request;
use Twig\Environment;
use Twig\Loader\FilesystemLoader;
use Webreg\Query\RotationManagementQuery;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
use Webreg\Repository\GameRepository;
use Webreg\ViewModel\RotationsUsingDoctrine;

class RotationManagementQueryTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    public function it_returns_expected_rotation(): void
    {
        // Arrange
        $loader = new FilesystemLoader(__DIR__ . '/../../templates/');
        $twig = new Environment($loader);

        $gamesRepo = $this-&gt;createMock(GameRepository::class);
        $gamesRepo-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getMaxWeek')
            -&gt;willReturn(1);

        $testRotation = new ArrayCollection();
        $testRotation-&gt;add([
            'franchise_id' =&gt; 1,
            'ibl' =&gt; 'MAD',
            'rotation' =&gt; 'One, Two, Three'
        ]);

        $viewModel = $this-&gt;createMock(RotationsUsingDoctrine::class);
        $viewModel-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getAllByWeek')
            -&gt;willReturn($testRotation);

        $request = $this-&gt;createMock(Request::class);
        $request-&gt;expects($this-&gt;once())
            -&gt;method('getQueryParams')
            -&gt;willReturn(['week' =&gt; 1]);

        // Act
        $query = new RotationManagementQuery($twig, $gamesRepo, $viewModel);
        $results = $query-&gt;__invoke($request);

        // Assert
        self::assertStringContainsString('One, Two, Three', $results-&gt;getBody());
    }
}

</code></pre>

<p>Some thoughts that occur to me from looking at the final test:</p>

<ul>
<li>decoupling makes your dependencies quite visible during test creation</li>
<li>always make sure to only implement the behaviour of your test doubles that you need</li>
<li>your Arrange step will almost always be the largest part of any test</li>
<li>PHPUnit's built-in test double generators also act as assertions</li>
<li>sometimes the simplest way of verifying behaviour is what you should use</li>
</ul>

<p>From my perspective, decoupling the code allows me to focus on smaller
pieces of application behaviour, reducing the chances that a change in
this code breaks something somewhere else.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over on Twitter Mathias Verraes tweeted something that immediately 
triggered some feelings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Perhaps TDD isn't as ubiquitous as it should be because you
    can't make a business model out of it.
    (Original post on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/status/1595100145129263106">https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/status/1595100145129263106</a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I commented saying "Boy do I ever have feelings about this topic..." and
Matias asked me to share. I decided my response was better off as
a longer blog post. Don't worry, this will end up on Twitter / Mastodon
anyway.</p>

<p>He mentioned "observability" as a technique that ended up
being a very good business model. Why? In my opinion, figuring out
how to observe something in production is generic enough in that you
can create a tool and say "hey, add these stuff to your code or
production systems, and it will report stuff to this well-crafted
dashboard you can use to get an idea of what is going on."</p>

<p>I am a fan of these approach -- I highly recommend looking into
things like <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io">Honeycomb</a> to get an idea
of what you are signing up for when you choose that path.</p>

<p>So what about testing? Is testing generic enough that you could come
up with some kind of black box or external system that you can connect
your tests to and react to when things fail?</p>

<p>Tests are almost entirely bespoke. Dependent on architecture. Dependent
on environments. Heck, dependant on the skill of the people who have to
write and maintain them.</p>

<p>Also, in my experience, tests work best when you approach them from
the idea that they are there to make sure things are behaving as you
expect them to and to give you a way to determine if you've made changes
that have broken something elsewhere in your application.</p>

<p>In other words, chances are that a failing test is something that the
users of your application will never notice. They will notice broken
pages, non-functioning links, slow-to-respond interfaces. Those are things
that can probably be monitored through observability tools.</p>

<p>In a lot of cases you start off with the idea of having to add tests to
a system being adversarial. Developers don't want to spend the time
writing them. Management views them as tasks with little-to-no return
on investments. Clients balk at being told your bid is more expensive because
you are writing tests. Flaky tests reduce confidence. Build tools need
to be able to play nicely with your chosen testing tools. Effective
test suites can take a lot of time to create and maintain.</p>

<p>Not to mention almost nobody teaches people how to learn to use a programming
language from a test-centric perspective. I could not even imagine
how to teach a novice programmer how to use PHP while also showing them
how to use all the tools. Understanding my own target audience is developers-with-experience
has really changed how I teach and what I teach them.</p>

<p>Using an observability tool
can often be as simple as signing up for an online tool, follow their
directions on what needs to happen to monitor things, and then you
will know a lot faster when things aren't behaving correctly in
production.</p>

<p>Under those types of terms, testing will never be ubiquitous. Which
is a shame because it is a technique that can lead to stable code
bases and confident deployments to production.</p>

<p>Maybe someone out there with a different perspective will figure out
how to solve the stuff I talked about here. Until then, I am still happy
to help teach people how to add automated testing to their skill set
and hope they find it as useful as I have.</p>

            <link href="https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2022/11/18/a-grumpy-posse/"/>
            <updated>2022-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://grumpy-learning.com/blog/2022/11/18/a-grumpy-posse/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the main reasons I have decided to embrace more of
the <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a> ethos is out of a desire
to have more control over where the various things I create
(micro-blogging and longer-form content) ends up. Twitter ended
up being something that replaced the blogging I used to do.</p>

<p>One of the concepts coming out of the Indieweb is the great-sounding
acronym POSSE. It stands for Publish On your own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere.
Which is another way of saying you should have one central location
where most of your material lives (shitposting on social media still will
happen) and then push that content out to other places.</p>

<p>So for me, what would this look like?</p>

<p>For a long time I had another blog, but once I really leaned into the
Grumpy Programmer brand that blog served no purpose and I really should've
just moved stuff over there. Although that old blog is no longer online
I still have all the posts I made to it. Maybe I will go through one day
and do "the best of when I was less grumpy" or something like that.</p>

<p>So, in a world where I embrace POSSE, here is how it should work:</p>

<ul>
<li>I write content on this blog</li>
<li>I use the static site generator <a href="https://sculpin.io">Sculpin</a> to create the site</li>
<li>As part of updating my site, I then automatically publish a link to that blog elsewhere</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other solutions to make this happen if you use other blogging
engines (static or otherwise) but there was nothing out-of-the-box to make it
work for Sculpin. So, I used my <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">favourite search engine</a>
and started doing some research.</p>

<p>I also, like any good online influencer, leveraged my personal relationships
with people...like the current maintainer of Sculpin...to ask them how I could accomplish
a few tasks.</p>

<h2 id="writing-on-this-blog">Writing on this blog</h2>

<p>Sculpin supports me writing posts using Markdown. This means I get to keep using
the <a href="https://neovim.io">new One True Editor</a> to create new posts. It also uses
<a href="https://twig.symfony.com">Twig</a> for the templates it uses to generate the static
HTML for the site.</p>

<p>Again, I am not telling you one way or the other what to use for your blog. For a lot
of folks using <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> and a plugin tailored to IndieWeb
needs will work. I didn't want to setup anything new, so I was going to stick with
Sculpin.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-site">Creating the site</h2>

<p>I am currently using GitHub pages for this site, so all I have to do is copy the
generated HTML output into the correct location in the repo that holds my site,
push those changes up to GitHub and in a minute or two I have a new version of
my web site for all the world to see.</p>

<p>This is no big change for what I was doing previously -- I used to have an AWS
Lightsail instance for hosting the blog but decided GitHub was a better option
since I was already paying for an account there. Why pay twice?!?</p>

<p>Now, to prepare my site to be "IndieWeb friendly" is simply followed the instructions
at <a href="https://indiewebify.me">IndeWebify.me</a>. Followed by, of course, a lot of
commits and pushes to get things to behave exactly the way I needed them to.</p>

<p>For example. this is what the template looks like for a blog post, with all the
IndieWeb <a href="https://microformats.org/">microformats</a> embedded in them:</p>

<pre><code>
{% extends "default" %}

{% block head_meta %}
    &lt;meta name="robots" content="index, follow"&gt;

{% block content_wrapper %}
    &lt;article class="h-entry"&gt;

        &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;div class="e-content"&gt;
            {{ page.blocks.content|raw }}
        &lt;/div&gt;
        {% if page.categories %}
            &lt;p class="categories"&gt;
            Categories:
            {% for category in page.categories %}
            &lt;a class="p-category" href="{{ site.url }}/blog/categories/{{ category|url_encode(true) }}"&gt;{{ category }}&lt;/a&gt;{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}
            &lt;/p&gt;
        {% endif %}
        {% if page.tags %}
            &lt;p class="tags"&gt;
            Tags:
            {% for tag in page.tags %}
            &lt;a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/tags/{{ tag|url_encode(true) }}"&gt;{{ tag }}&lt;/a&gt;{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}
            &lt;/p&gt;
        {% endif %}
        &lt;a href="https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon"&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://brid.gy/publish/twitter"&lt;/a&gt;
        {% if page.previous_post or page.next_post %}
            &lt;nav class="article"&gt;
                &lt;ul&gt;
                    {% if page.next_post %}
                        &lt;li&gt;Next: &lt;a class="next" href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.next_post.url }}" title="{{ page.next_post.title }}"&gt;&lt;span class="title"&gt;{{ page.next_post.title }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    {% endif %}
                    {% if page.previous_post %}
                        &lt;li&gt;Previous: &lt;a class="previous" href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.previous_post.url }}" title="{{ page.previous_post.title }}"&gt;&lt;span class="title"&gt;{{ page.previous_post.title }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                    {% endif %}
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/nav&gt;
        {% endif %}
    &lt;/article&gt;
{% endblock %}

<h2 id="the-grumpy-posse">The Grumpy POSSE</h2>

<p>Figuring out how to syndicate my content without an existing plugin proved to
be a bit of a challenge. Luckily, I found a blog post that explained how to
make this work by embracing <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmentions</a>
and using an awesome (and free!) service called <a href="https://brid.gy">Bridgy</a>
to automate syndication.</p>

<p>The solution I found was to create a GitHub action that would be triggered
each time I did a push to the repo. This action would take care of using
webmentions and Brid.gy to do the magic. But first, I needed a feed of
my website that was in JSON, not XML.</p>

<p>So I hit up <a href="https://phpc.social/@kboyd">Kevin Boyd</a> and ask him how
could I do this in Sculpin. He very gracious created a Twig template
that would turn my list of blog posts into a JSON feed. Here it is
in all it's glory:</p>

<pre><code>
---
permalink: feed.json
use:
    - posts
---
{#
     Example data structure for delivering a Webmentions feed:

     From: https://blog.geheimesite.nl/en/index.json

     [
        {
            "author": {},
            "categories": ,
            "content": "yadda yadda yadda",
            "date": "2022-05-03T16:27:18+02:0",
            "site": "https://whateverthing.com/",
            "tags": null,
            "title": "Article One",
            "uri": "https://whateverthing.com/2022/11/11/article-one/"
        },
        {
            "author": {},
            "categories": ,
            "content": "yadda yadda yadda",
            "date": "2022-06-03T16:27:18+02:0",
            "site": "https://whateverthing.com/",
            "tags": null,
            "title": "Article Two",
            "uri": "https://whateverthing.com/2022/11/11/article-two/"
        },
     ]
#}
{% set outputArray = [] %}

{% for post in data.posts[:10] %}
    {%
        set postOutput = {
            'author': site.author,
            'categories': post.meta.categories,
            'content': post.blocks.content|raw,
            'date': post.date|date("c"),
            'site': site.global_url,
            'tags': post.meta.tags,
            'title': post.title,
            'uri': [ site.global_url, post.url]|join
        }
    %}
    {% set outputArray = outputArray|merge([postOutput]) %}
{% endfor %}

{{ outputArray|json_encode(constant('JSON_PRETTY_PRINT'))|raw }}

</code></pre>

<p>I dropped that into the root directory Sculpin uses for generating
my site, named it <code>feed.json.twig</code> and now I had a JSON-based feed
for the site.</p>

<p>Now, the GitHub action. This would go in <code>.github/workflows/send-webmention.yaml</code>
for my repo that I am using for the page.</p>

<pre><code>name: Send Webmentions

on: push

jobs:
  send:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: Send Webmentions
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: $
          URL: $
        run: |
          NEW=$(curl --silent $URL | jq -r first.uri)

          curl -X POST https://webmention.app/check?url="https://grumpy.learning.com$NEW"

          curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST \
          -d source="https://grumpy-learning.com$NEW" \
          -d target="https://brid.gy/publish/twitter" \
          "https://brid.gy/publish/webmention"

          curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST \
          -d source="https://grumpy-learning.com$NEW" \
          -d target="https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon" \
          "https://brid.gy/publish/webmention"
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/dianoetic/b45466a7c04fa47cf80905b182dbda3c">original instructions</a> recommended
putting the JSON feed details into a secret and then referencing it inside the action.
I am not sure it matters that much but stuck with it.</p>

<p>So, the next thing is that it grabs the feed using <a href="https://curl.se">cURL</a> and grabs what
it thinks is the latest post (the first one in the feed) and then proceeds to use
<a href="https://webmention.app">webmention.app</a> and Brid.gy to syndicate my content by sharing
the post title and linking to it).</p>

<p>So far it is working well and if you came across this post via my social media microblogging (I
sound so pretentious when I say it out loud) then it clearly worked.</p>

<p>I think my takeway from this is that gluing things together so your existing blog
can syndicate content to a variety of platforms. If you're looking to have more control over
the things you share online, I highly recommend looking into the IndieWeb. I hope this post helps!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I write this blog post, Twitter is convulsing as it's new
owner Elon Musk is trying to treat a huge cruise ship like
it's a jetski. Having cut a ton of staff and literally workshopping
ideas in public, it's not going well.</p>

<p>I have ignored blogging and some other interactions as Twitter made
it so easy to share those little thoughts and I also became reliant
on a curated feed to find stuff I was interested in. Along the way
I ran into the idea of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>.</p>

<p>I have made a non-trivial amount of money off selling my <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/chartjes">books</a>
and have dabbled in paid courses and workshops. So it made a lot of
sense to me to check out this <a href="https://indiewebify.me">guide to joining the IndieWeb</a>
and learn about <a href="https://microformats.org">microformats</a>, <a href="http://webmention.org/">Webmentions</a>
and start really leaning into POSSEing (Publish on my Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere)
my stuff.</p>

<p>This is the first blog post that (if I have set up things correctly at my end) that
will be syndicated out to other platforms.</p>
