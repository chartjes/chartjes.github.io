            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just got back from speaking at <a href="https://cascadiaphp.com">CascadiaPHP</a>
and wanted to share some thoughts about how I approach going to conferences
as a speaker and maybe you will find it helpful too.</p>

<h3 id="you-are-playing-a-dual-role">You are playing a dual role</h3>

<p>I have been going to conferences since 2003 and speaking at them since 2005.
That is a very long time, spanning the vast majority of my professional
career. Most of my energy and attention are devoted to making sure that
I deliver the best talk I can at the time I give it.</p>

<p>I also need to show other attendees that I still have things to learn so
I make sure to go to other talks.</p>

<p>I understand that for some folks time pressures are such that they come in,
give a talk, and then immediately leave. I am not a fan of that approach and
would never do it -- I would just simply decline the opportunity. But for
many events they are marketed as an opportunity to get access to some of
the most knowledgeable people in your programming community. So I feel
you should give back by making sure to talk to other people, make some
new community friends, and encourage people to continue to attend these
events.</p>

<p>So make sure to support your other speakers by attending their talks. I
know I missed some talks at CascadiaPHP because I was not handling
the 3-hour time difference well and I was catching up with some old friends
during other talks. I did get to some talks of things I was interested in
and that is really what we are here for.</p>

<h3 id="know-your-material">Know your material</h3>

<p>I will admit that I often don't practice my talks because I make sure I
really know the material before I present. I think I can mostly get away
with this because of my presentation style -- it is kind of like walking
a tightrope.</p>

<p>So even if you can't practice your talk a lot, if you understand the
material really well then a collection of slides that act as the initial
thoughts you want to go over, and then you fill in the rest yourself
makes for really engaging talks.</p>

<h3 id="answer-questions-and-ask-questions">Answer questions and ask questions</h3>

<p>This can be hard for people who suffer from "imposter syndrome". My joke
about this is that my ego is too large for me to think I am an imposter,
but the truth is I am highly confident that I can figure out how to do
just about anything. The key to pulling that off is to understand when
you don't know something and then figure out who you can ask for help.</p>

<p>In the context of a conference, I try to do talks that question the
way some things are, present my point of view, and then ask the audience
to consider what I've told them. You don't have to agree with everything
I say (talks that like that are boring) but I do actually change my mind
over time and with experience. So try and get your audience thinking
and wanting to ask questions.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you are watching someone else's talk and don't understand
what is going on, ask them a question if you can. I generally ask people
to save their questions for the end of my talks but feel free to go with
whatever feels right for you.</p>

<p>A great example of this is the topic of <a href="https://phpstan.org/blog/generics-by-examples">generics in PHP</a>. I have never
used them and have not been able to figure out on my own why they might
be useful to me. There was a talk about <a href="https://phpstan.org">PHPStan</a>
and they mentioned generics. I didn't ask the speaker about them as
I got to the end so instead I asked some of my fellow developers if
they could explain to me why I should care about them. They provided
me with some insights into when and where I might want to use them
so next time I am building something that could benefit from Generics,
I will give it a try.</p>

<p>If I hadn't asked, a question I probably would still be thinking they were something
I would not have to worry about.</p>

<h3 id="take-care-of-yourself">Take care of yourself</h3>

<p>Make sure to eat.</p>

<p>Make sure to get proper amounts of rest.</p>

<p>Don't treat the conference like it's an excuse to cut loose and abuse yourself.</p>

<p>I don't want to say things like "be a professional" because that on it's own
is really insulting. Instead, be respectful towards yourself.</p>

<h3 id="have-your-slides-done-ahead-of-time">Have your slides done ahead of time</h3>

<p>There is the trope of folks doing their slides at the last minute. In almost
every case I have my slides all done before I come to the event, This time
I ended up needing to devote the time I would've spent on slides for one
of my presentations doing stuff around my house getting it ready to be sold.
I ended up finishing the slides in my hotel room during a block of talks
that I did not find interesting enough to attend.</p>

<h3 id="sometimes-the-talk-just-doesn%27t-work">Sometimes the talk just doesn't work</h3>

<p>This final one is tricky. Sometimes, a talk just doesn't resonate with the
audience. You miscalculated how much time you had. You wanted to talk theory
but the audience was expecting examples. You only prepared 30 minutes when
the slot was an hour. It was the first time you gave the talk. It happens.
I view them as teachable lessons about what the audience is expecting from
you, which becomes even more important if you are lucky enough to have
a long enough speaking career where there are expectations that you are
going to be a certain way.</p>

<p>We can all learn from our challenges -- failing to do so is the real issue.</p>

<h3 id="you-made-it%21">You made it!</h3>

<p>If you want to an event and spoke, congratulations! Now try and make the
experience for your audience and yourself just a little bit better next time.</p>

<p>Is it possible to both be excited and filled with dread at buying a house and moving? We found
a place in the small town where we live (literally a 5 minute drive) and buying
it is conditional on selling our current place in a very tight window (about 5
weeks).</p>

<p>I'm pretty organized these days so the move will likely go smooth but I am going
to spend all winter in a foul move if it falls through.</p>

at home and my annual visit to go see the Tigers play
at Comerica Field the last weekend they are at home.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I Did</h2>

<ul>
<li>the IBL regular season is almost over -- 2 weeks to go and my team sits at 73-73</li>
<li>got a foul ball at the Tigers' game -- I whiffed on catching it but it hit me in the gut and dropped to my feet. Awesome souvenir for my buddy's 10yo son</li>
<li>two weeks of fun Commander play, with 20 people coming out each time</li>
<li>finally getting some time to work on my Magic: The Gathering <a href="https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/grumpycursed">cube</a></li>
<li>some of the last pieces of my work task related to purchase validation are getting built</li>
<li>demo of some other features built by the rest of the team went well</li>
<li>pool is now closed as we settle in for a Southwestern Ontario fall</li>
<li>started working on my slides for my two talks at <a href="https://cascadiaphp.com">CascadiaPHP 2024</a></li>
<li>house hunting has started as we look for something without a pool (I'm the only one really using it, plus with our youngest having epilepsy there is significant risk to her swimming) and move from a two-story home to a bungalow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="longer-threads">Longer Threads</h2>

<p>Nothing really other than my absences from home make me realize what
a creature of routine I have become over the years. Even an overnight
visit feels like it was super long. Weird sensation for sure.</p>

<li>amazing turnout for Commander night -- 24 people</li>

<p>This upcoming Monday I am going to a meeting with my mother
at the nursing home where my father lives to go over his
care. Some of you might know that my father is suffering 
from dementia for about a decade now and has been in
this home for 2-1/2 years now.</p>

<p>I try and see him whenever I go back to visit my mom and
for the most part the visits have gone okay. He seems to
almost always remember that he has a son and the last
few visits he always recognizes my mother. Conversations
are hard because he doesn't remember anything and I don't
have enough things on my phone to really distract him. My
mother often brings an iPad with her and shows him videos
or pictures of things.</p>

<p>The whole thing is really, really sad. I have no idea if
I will dodge the same fate as him.</p>

<p>I think the thing that bothers me the most is that while
he looks like and sounds like my Dad, it's not. He never
remembers I have kids or that I am married. I haven't
heard him talk about my older sister at all.</p>

<p>I just wish he was able to experience that his son truly
made it and has a nice comfortable life.</p>

<li>has my usual Commander Night at my local gaming store</li>
<li>the transaction audit log work is proving to be a slog</li>
<li>discovered that you can configure PhpStorm's <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/using-product-as-the-vim-editor.html">IdeaVim</a> plugin via a <code>.ideavimrc</code> file to make the experience a little more Vim-like.

<li>flights booked for going to <a href="https://cascadiaphp.com">CascadiaPHP</a> at the end of October</li>
<li>a testing scenario for the transaction audit log revealed that my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern">chain-of-responsibility</a> implementation for a series of validators for a rebate offer was just wrong, so off I went fixing it by switching to using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/helpers#pipeline">pipelines in laravel</a>. Don't worry, all the individual validators have tests</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="longer-threads">Longer Threads</h2>

<p>I was going to do a longer piece on how I felt I was at
a "crossroads" with my IDE choices. I know it sounds like
dramatic whining.</p>

<p>I have been a Vim/NeoVim user for a long time. The HJKL
muscle memory is burned in and I expect almost everything
I use to be modal. For everything other than PHP, I use
NeoVim.</p>

<p>But lately I am feeling...resentful about how all the tools
I have started to rely on seem to have "becoming a subscription"
as an aspirational goal. My renewal for my PhpStorm subscription
is coming up and I am trying to decide if I can just not renew
it and go back to NeoVim.</p>

<p>The ONLY reason I switched to using PhpStorm was because it
made some other aspects of development work easier:</p>

<ul>
<li>easily get Xdebug working and a slick interface for it</li>
<li>same with doing development work with Dockerized development environments</li>
<li>make it easy to run my tests inside that Dockerized environments</li>
<li>"intellesense" support baked in</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other editors I have looked at -- <a href="https://helix-editor.com">Helix</a>,
<a href="https://zed.dev">Zed</a>, and even the dreaded Emacs. Other than Emacs,
the newer editors fall down when we get to the plugin and
customization phage of creating a development environment.</p>

<p>From a pragmatic side, sticking with NeoVim due to intimate 
familiarity with it's modal nature and basic keybindings
makes the most sense.</p>

<p>Emacs is an interesting choice because it is basically like
NeoVim in that it has a long, rich history and is incredibly
configurable. But learning a whole new series of keybindings?
Seems very daunting.</p>

<p>Helix seems nice. Xdebug support appears to be very rough to
get working. Have to have it for my PHP work, sorry. No idea
if it can be made to support Xdebug running inside a Docker
container. Again, need to check back later.</p>

<p>Zed -- no support for Xdebug. I'll check back later when
they maybe bake in Debug Anywhere Protocol support.</p>

<p>So time to see if I can get NeoVim to give me the extra
tooling that PhpStorm currently offers.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="longer-threads">Longer Threads</h2>

<p>I read an excelled blog post from Steven Yegge where he talked about how
he felt it was a <a href="https://sourcegraph.com/blog/the-death-of-the-junior-developer?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">bad time to be a junior developer</a>,
which dovetails nicely into me needing to deliver a talk at the end
of October to the audience at <a href="https://cascadiaphp.com">Cascadia PHP</a>
about how a hater like me uses LLM's.</p>

<p>I don't want to spoil the main points of the talk, but it is fair
to say I already use some LLM's (Apple iPhone already has stuff
in it) and I have occasionally turned it on when trying to refactor
some code.</p>

<p>Can't ignore all the grifters and rent-seekers hanging around
the industry and it does feel like a bubble is gonna pop.</p>

<p>I tried out Emacs this week at work for a little bit each
day and it is just different enough from what my Vim
muscle memory wants that I have put it on hold.</p>

<p>Instead, I am concentrating on building new muscle memory
to use <a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">home row mods</a>
to reduce how often I have to reach for the Shift and Alt keys.
It's jarring to actually feel the pause as I stop to use the
home row "shift".</p>

<p>I came across a blog post from a developer about <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-08-11-why-emacs-switch/">why they switched to Emacs</a>
and it make me wonder if I should try switching from Vim to Emacs. Again.</p>

<p>I tried it once before but couldn't duplicate my developer work flow.
I feel like the combination of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> + <a href="http://xahlee.info/emacs/misc/xah-fly-keys.html">xah-fly-keys</a> is
a great start since it would give me a similar modal editing experience
that I expect in my editor.</p>

<p>Of course, the bigger issue is that I would have to set things up twice
-- once on my work computer that ZiffDavis gave me and once on my own
machine. I also pay for a license for <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a>
and it is up for renewal soon.</p>

<p>Good to keep learning things. I've been using Vim so long that navigating via H-J-K-L
is deeply embedded in muscle memory. I have noticed over the years that I don't really
do much "web surfing" on my laptop -- I use my iPhone for that so having Vim bindings
for my browser doesn't make mush sense.</p>

It's not that my ego think you want to know about all aspects

<h2 id="longer-threads">Longer Threads</h2>

<p>I keep coming back to the phrase "post-testing software development world" and are finally organizing these thoughts.
I should probably do a series of blog posts here about it. It's clear that things have definitely shifted in terms
of commitment to testing and with an audience mostly-receptive to the concepts, a shift in how to teach and
advocate for testing seems reasonable.</p>

<p>For all the insults that PHP catches, one that seems to
never come up is how good <a href="https://xdebug.org">Xdebug</a> is
for figuring out what might be going on in an application.</p>

<p>I have been porting over a Python web app that is used to
trigger a batch processing job that validates online purchases.
I have been rewriting parts of it in PHP + Laravel + queue workers
and as part of the testing, I was trying to figure out why I
could not trigger the batch processing properly.</p>

<p>I have been spoiled by being able to use Xdebug to figure out
what is going on with my PHP applications, but had never used
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">Python's debugger</a>.</p>

<p>Since I am a happy <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm">PhpStorm</a> user
I figured I should also use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm">PyCharm</a>
to do my Python dev work. I figured they were similar enough that it
wouldn't be painful to debug.</p>

<p>As an aside, learning how to use a debugger for your preferred programming
language will give you real productivity gains. No more <code>die('here')</code> statements
in your code.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-this-work-in-python%3F">How does this work in Python?</h2>

<p>So, having no experience with Python debugging I ass-u-me'd that it would
be behaving similar to how Xdebug does things:</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure you have a version of Python with debugger support</li>
<li>it sends messages out on a specific port</li>
<li>tell the IDE to listen</li>
<li>set your breakpoint</li>
<li>wait for the nice debugger output to come up</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, dear friends, this is not how it worked at all. I was stumped and
wondering "why doesn't it work like Xdebug?!?". Which is, of course,
silly. It was just my assumptions that were wrong.</p>

<p>I spent some time doing online searches with all sorts of variations
on how to debug Python apps in PyCharm. Lots of interesting and
helpful blog posts...none of which covered what I was trying to do.</p>

<p>I asked on federated social media for some help -- again, some helpful
advice but I got variations of "don't try it that way". Now, that is
well-intentioned but not really an answer.</p>

<p>I had a web app, running locally inside a Python virtual environment. This
shouldn't be hard. I was starting to think that the issue was that I was
not using the same terms as everyone else.</p>

<p>With a running app, I kept wondering "so how do I continually restart the
application to turn on the debugger" as that seemed to me at the time
the only solution for the issue.</p>

<p>Clearly, I was doing it wrong.</p>

<p>While doing some more random searches, I finally stumbled across something
that turned out the be the solution. In a blog post (sorry, I did not
bookmark it) about debugging another Python web application the person
said "...and just attach the debugger to a running process".</p>

<p>Apologies to people who might not get the reference, but if you've ever
seen an image of a person thinking about something and then a light bulb
goes on over head? That is what it was like.</p>

<h2 id="debugging-by-attaching-to-a-running-process">Debugging by attaching to a running process</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that these details are while using PyCharm 2024.1.4 (Professional Edition).
So, in my situation I had this:</p>

<ul>
<li>project is configured in PyCharm to use the Python interpreter in my virtual environment</li>
<li>the application is running</li>
<li>I have set a breakpoint in my Python code</li>
</ul>

<p>Inside PyCharm I went to <code>Run &gt; Attatch to Process</code> and was presented with
some Python processes along with their process ID (I'm on MacOS). I selected the
one for my application and then made my request to the web app to turn
start the batch processing and it worked! I could now
debug things inside and figure out how things are working.</p>

<p>Hope this helps folks who are less-familiar with Python and it's
debugging capabilities get up to speed faster.</p>
